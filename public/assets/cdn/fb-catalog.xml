      <g:description><![CDATA[
Absence Management Certification
Occasional employee absence is unavoidable, but frequent absence comes at a considerable cost to an organisation. Absent employees cost their employers money and time and repeated absence can lower morale. A team will feel discouraged if one or more of their members are often away from work and this can lead to resentment and tension in the workplace.

Ultimately, persistent employee absence has a detrimental effect on profits and can damage valuable relationships between a business and its clients. Therefore, all organisations need to take a proactive approach when it comes to absence management and prevention. Fortunately, you can reduce absenteeism by understanding the underlying causes and taking practical steps to reduce it.

In this course, you will learn why employees may be absent from work, how to handle instances of absence, how to help those with genuine reasons for absence return to the workplace and how to discipline employees who are absent without good cause. You will discover how to strike a balance between supporting the needs of your organisation while promoting the health and wellbeing of its employees.
You Will Learn:-

 	What is meant by employee absence, the financial costs of absence and why it is imperative that all businesses think carefully about how to handle it.
 	The most common reasons for both short-term and long-term absences and how the causes of absence vary by sector.
 	The elements that make up a good absence management policy and how to ensure that it is implemented in a consistent way.
 	The practical steps line managers and business owners can take when disciplining and dismissing employees with a history of frequent or prolonged absences.
 	How to prevent absence by improving working conditions, raising morale and offering effective incentives.

Benefits Of Taking This Course:-

 	If you are in a management role, this course will give you the confidence to talk to employees about absence and to implement absence policies.
 	If you are responsible for drawing up absence policies, this course will help you devise fair, effective procedures that promote a healthy workplace.
 	If you own a business or are the head of an organisation, this course will encourage you to examine your workplace culture and understand how it may foster a culture of absenteeism.
 	You will gain practical insights into measures that reduce employee absence, which will allow you to immediately start tackling the problem in your own organisation.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Alcohol at Work Awareness
Alcohol is not harmful when consumed in moderation, but the effects of alcohol abuse and dependency can be severe. Problematic drinking not only affects an individual’s private life, but can also have a detrimental impact on their performance at work. This can result in decreased productivity, low morale and high absence rates. 7% of adults regularly exceed recommended safe limits for alcohol consumption. This means that most organisations will employ workers with problematic drinking habits at some point and it is best to prepare in advance for the possibility that an employee may at some stage require help to overcome their alcohol abuse or addiction.

Alcohol abuse is a sensitive subject and employers may feel ill-prepared to approach and assist employees who need help. Fortunately, organisations can learn how to reduce levels of problematic drinking among their employees, offer support to workers who need help controlling their alcohol intake and take steps to create a healthy, safe working environment. This course contains practical advice for employers across all sectors.
You Will Learn

 	What alcohol misuse and addiction are, why problematic drinking has negative effects on both an employee and their organisation and why employers have a legal duty to address alcohol abuse in the workplace.
 	Why every employer needs to draw up a comprehensive alcohol policy and the key issues to consider when putting together a policy document.
 	How to spot signs of alcohol abuse in the workplace, how to approach an employee who misuses alcohol and the support an employee may require during treatment.
 	Why some workers are more likely than others to abuse alcohol, how a working environment can contribute to alcohol misuse and the role of screening in the workplace.

Benefits Of Taking This Course

 	If you are in a supervisory role, you will benefit from learning how to identify the most common signs of alcohol abuse in your team.
 	If you work in an HR role, this course will provide you with valuable background information regarding alcohol abuse. This will help you offer support to employees who engage in problematic drinking.
 	If you are in a management or HR role, you will benefit from the opportunity to learn how to put together an effective alcohol policy.
 	If you are considering a career in occupational health, this course will provide you with a useful introduction to the impact of alcohol on employees and organisations.

      <g:title><![CDATA[Alternative Medicine (Lightning Skills Bundle) Certificate]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[Alternative Medicine Lightning Skills Certificate
Alternative medicine is a broad and intriguing field of medicinal principles and practices that are not considered to be mainstream. Western medicine is considered the traditional and mainstream form of medicine, practised by medical professionals across the world. When medical treatment isn’t quite traditional, it’s usually called a form of alternative medicine. The term also covers some of the world’s most ancient forms of medicinal therapy and medical practices. Chinese medicine and herbal solutions were around even before Western medicine and are still used in many areas today.

A good thing to keep in mind when learning about alternative medicine is that it’s best used as a complement to traditional medical methods, not a complete replacement. However, alternative medicine foundations and methods have proven to be very effective and important in treating ailments from the common cold to a constant feeling of stress. There are many benefits to learning about the history of medicine and the roots of healing.

The field of alternative medicine covers many different theories, backgrounds and practices. In this course bundle, you will focus on some of the most unique and used forms of alternative medicine.

 	How to safely and responsibly use and communicate some forms of alternative medicine. One of the best things about alternative medicine is that it does not always require a medical professional. There are tangible ways for anyone to play a role in their own health or the health of their friends and family.

Benefits of Taking This Course:

 	You will have access to eight courses, each dedicated to giving you a comprehensive understanding of a different alternative medicine topic. By the end of this course bundle, you will be well-versed in several different areas of alternative medicine.

Animal Reiki is a healing technique. Dating back to thousands of years ago, Reiki uses positive divine energy to heal animals. It has the same effect on both humans and animals.

Anyone can join Reiki classes to take up a career in the therapy, or use it to heal their pets whenever they feel unbalanced for better well-being. You can practice Reiki and become an expert in providing Reiki energy healing. With proper training, you can be licensed and certified as a Reiki healer.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Assessing Mental Capacity


The Mental Capacity Act 2005 was formulated with a view to providing clear guidelines regarding assessing the mental capacity of an individual. Lack of mental capacity can lead to loss of freedom, and others may make decisions for you. This is often a transitional point in the life of any individual. 

This makes it all the more important that mental capacity must be evaluated using the correct techniques and methods. It’s important to assess an individual’s mental capacity correctly, and the conclusion should not be based on the individual’s age, appearance or disabilities, if any. 

What You Will Learn in This Course:

	Why there are concerns regarding assessing mental capacity

 
	The relationship between mental capacity and decision-making


	An overview of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and how it underlies the principles of mental capacity assessment 


	The two-stage assessment test and the five principles of the MCA

      <g:description><![CDATA[Body Language Diploma
This course on ‘Body Language’ is designed to help you understand the different aspects of body language so that you are able to use the information to your personal and professional advantage. In addition, you can also consider using the knowledge to train others in the understanding of body language.

Actions truly speak louder than words and it is possible to convey volumes of meaning without uttering a single syllable in the process. Body language is an intricate subject and detailed insights described in the course reveal the secrets of successful communication. Learning the nuances of body language can not only help you connect better with your co-workers, but can also help reduce conflict and improve your skills in negotiation as well as customer interactions.

In addition, becoming more aware of the subtle cues associated with gestures, expressions and position can also help us improve self-awareness. We become more aware of how our communications are perceived by others. As a result, we are more likely to enjoy more fulfilling and loving personal relationships with family members, friends and other loved ones.

Paying attention to body language and gestures can help us discern between truthful and untruthful communications. If you work or volunteer in a field that involves interaction with disabled or autistic individuals, interpretation of body language can help you forge closer and more understanding relationships with your students or patients.
What you will learn
The course offers information, insights and explanations regarding the following:

 	The fundamentals of body language and its importance in our everyday lives in terms of business and personal relationships.
 	The impact of cultural differences on the understanding and interpretation of body language.
 	Understanding one’s own body language and the unspoken communication that we tend to convey through our gestures, postures and expressions.
 	You will also be able to identify signs that indicate lying or concealing behaviours. This will help you further improve your ability to interact on a professional as well as personal level.
 	As you learn to identify negative body language, you will gradually eliminate these gestures or posture. You will be able to adopt a more mindful attitude towards body language.
 	Body language plays a crucial role when it comes to attending job interviews, negotiating a business deal or interacting with customers. The course will explain how to improve the likelihood of business or job success by using the correct body language.
 	In addition to work situations, body language also plays an integral role in personal relationships and development. The course will describe different interpretations of body language and the impact on interpersonal communication.

Body language is often a decisive factor that determines the overall effect of communication in professional as well as personal situations. Research indicates that most of our communication is influenced by subtle body language signals compared to actual spoken words.
Benefits of the Body Language course
By completing the course on body language, you can expect the following benefits:

 	Decrease the likelihood of conflicts that arise from misunderstanding others or being misunderstood.
 	Look forward to becoming a more established and effective communicator.
 	Improve your chances of business or job success.

      <g:title><![CDATA[British Sign Language Diploma]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[British Sign Language Course
Sign language is one of the only ways in which deaf people or those with hearing impairments are able to communicate. This type of language involves not only hand gestures but also facial expressions and body language, all combined to enable effective communication.

Sign language is now used all over the world in many different forms. In this online training course, we will primarily focus on the UK’s main form of sign language: British Sign Language.

The British Sign Langauge course will go over some of the main elements of this language, as well as its interesting history.

From there, the course will move on to explore some of the world’s other forms of sign language. American Sign Language is most commonly used worldwide, but there are actually hundreds of different versions of sign language.

The course will also take a look at the importance of deaf awareness and why sign language is such an irreplaceable tool. People who learn sign language have many opportunities in the job market, which this course will also go over.

You will then learn many commonly used words in BSL. These are covered in three separate stages:

1. ‘Foundation’ - alphabet, numbers, colours, animals
2. ‘Basic’ - people, hobbies, weather, transport, time
3. ‘Expansion’ - greetings, daily life, home, question forms, expressions, food and drink, compass

The BSL words will be demonstrated in videos. When practising the words yourself, try to copy exactly what the person in the video is doing.

Many signs require the use of only one hand, but some require both hands to be used. You can choose which is your dominant or main hand in signing - most people choose the hand they write with. Whichever you choose, make sure you are consistent. Don't start signing with one dominant hand and then change halfway through the conversation, as this will lead to confusion.

All in all, you will complete this BSL course with a good knowledge of sign language in general and, specifically, a sound understanding of British Sign Language.

You will then have enough knowledge to go on to complete the Level 1 Award in BSL.
BSL Course - What You Will Learn:

 	The difference between British Sign Language and other types of sign language around the world
 	How sign language is used, and why it’s so important
 	The basics and history of British Sign Language
 	Job opportunities for people who learn British Sign Language
 	Nearly 300 signs that can help in your day-to-day life

Benefits of Taking The British Sign Language Course:

 	Gain a working knowledge of British Sign Language
 	Discover what kinds of job opportunities people who know sign language have access to
 	Learn about important aspects of the deaf community, and help build awareness
 	Complete the course with valuable knowledge about sign language and its history
 	It’s a great introduction to BSL, before taking the Level 1 Award.

      <g:description><![CDATA[British Values

The recent rise in terrorist attacks and extremist activities has become a source of growing concern in Britain. Even more alarming is the threat of radicalisation of youth by Islamic terrorist groups. 

The Department for Education strongly suggests instilling British values from the early years as a means of counteracting the risks of radicalisation. 

What You Will Learn:

	The importance of British values and why they are a powerful tool to combat the risk of radicalisation


	How British values help students understand the difference between right and wrong by practising them in their daily lives


	The benefits and goals of introducing British values in schools and how SMSC (spiritual, moral, social and cultural development) can help support student development 


	How democracy and the rule of law allow a balance between freedom and accountability


	How mutual respect, individual liberty and tolerance play an important part in fostering harmony 


	How schools can promote these values in practical, effective ways 


The Benefits of Taking This Course:

This course can particularly benefit teachers and school staff who interact with children on a daily basis. 

	You will have the opportunity to instil British values in students right from an early age 


	By understanding each value, you can create innovative and practical activities to promote these values 


	You can allow students adequate freedom while simultaneously overseeing their efforts to create agreements, implement rules and think about current problems 


	You can organise debates, speech writing and essay contests to motivate students to think critically about important issues 


	Promoting British values at school helps you develop future citizens of the country who will act with fairness and tolerance 


The promotion of British values motivates students to resist radicalisation and brainwashing. Instilling British values helps students develop into mature, well-adjusted adults and allows them to positively contribute to life in modern Britain.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Child Neglect Certificate
Throughout the UK, nearly 10% of all children are experiencing or have experienced neglect. Living through this type of treatment can affect a person in childhood, as well as all the way through to adulthood.
Unfortunately, neglect is one of the hardest forms of child abuse to recognise, as it can appear subtly. In addition, many children who are neglected hide it as best they can, especially as they get older, and conditions worsen. Being able to identify the risk factors, signs and symptoms of child neglect can help you keep the children in your life safe.
This course goes into detail about child neglect. We begin by talking about the basic forms of neglect, including physical, emotional and educational, and how they manifest. Next, we review the factors that may mean that a child is at a higher risk of being neglected than their peers. A discussion of the warning signs of neglect, including the emotional and behavioural changes that a neglected child may exhibit, follows.
Finally, we review the best practices to keep in mind when responding to disclosures, as well as how you can report your concerns to the authorities.
You Will Learn:

What the long-term effects of child neglect are
How to identify children who are at risk by their behaviour and the situation
The factors that impact how a person responds to child neglect
The signs and symptoms that mean that you need to examine a child&rsquo;s situation in closer detail
What happens after you report your concerns

Benefits of Taking this Course:

Understanding more about the lifelong impact that neglect can have on a child
Learning more about the importance of reporting your concerns immediately
Understanding how neglect occurs and what the risk factors are
Being able to confidently look out for the children in your life whom you care about
Learning how to cope with allegations, disclosures and suspicions of neglect

In the UK alone, one in five children have endured severe mistreatment, including various forms of child abuse.

Those engaged in occupations that deal directly with children have a special obligation to look out for the children in their lives, while the rest of us have a moral obligation to protect the children whom we know.

This course goes into detail regarding child protection. We begin by giving you an introduction to child protection, including the rights that children have, as laid down by UK law and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

We also talk about the various pieces of legislation and government guidance in place that discusses child protection, the safeguarding of children and the roles and responsibilities that agencies play in this process.

Next, we review the types of child abuse that may be encountered, along with the possible indicators of each type of abuse.

 	How to use CBT techniques to reduce the impact of a client’s anxiety, overcome panic attacks and conquer phobias.
 	How thoughts, feelings and behaviours cause and maintain insomnia, and how CBT can help a client resume a normal sleeping pattern.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Combined Sales and Marketing Diploma Course
People say it is money that makes the world go around and in the business environment, there are a couple of key activities that when combined form a well-oiled machine that makes sure there are always customers and cash flowing into the business.
Sales and marketing are the two best friends walking hand-in-hand to help you achieve this ultimate goal. If you are looking to set up your own business, develop and market your idea or if you are simply looking to get a job in the fast-paced business environment, then this combined course is for you.
This ultimate sales and marketing course wraps up four key topics into separate courses - traditional marketing, digital marketing, advertising and sales. It is an overview of everything you should know and be doing in order to get your idea, product or business discovered.
The course takes you on a journey to explore these topics, learning key concepts and techniques and building a solid foundation of knowledge and practical experience as you work through the modules, teaching you how to make sure that people know, buy and love what you have to offer.
What you will learn:

The fundamentals of Search Engine Optimisation and how to make sure that your content can be discovered by search engines
What Web Analytics are and how they can help you see the effectiveness of your marketing campaigns.
The key difference between marketing and advertising and why it is important to distinguish between both activities
The anatomy of an advert and how knowing about message positioning can help you build a strong brand
How to plan and execute a successful advertising campaign and why this is important for promoting your product or business
What makes a piece of content go viral and how to use this for advertising purposes
The psychology of selling and the theory behind the typical sales cycle
How to become successful in sales and have people buy your products

Marketing Diploma
The demand for high quality marketers is increasing exponentially and there has never been a better time to get into the field. Hundreds of new companies are incorporated every day in the world and to get their name heard, all of them need marketing.
The Marketing Diploma explores the traditional methods and techniques used to promote and sell products and services.
Beginning with the theoretical introduction to the four P&rsquo;s of marketing, going through lessons focused on the practical ways to identify your potential client and their specific need, and wrapping up with step-by-step explanations of how to conduct a market research analysis, this course provides all the tools that a beginner in marketing may need in order to hone their skills.
Stepping up the game, apart from fundamental knowledge, the course features advanced topics in marketing focused on the importance of building your own marketing plan and how it will help you boost the results from marketing.
Digital Marketing Diploma
The fundamentals of traditional marketing outlined in the Marketing Diploma are further expanded in the Digital Marketing Diploma course that looks specifically into promoting your products or services using the digital channels that are available today.
The course touches on a variety of digital marketing tools and techniques.
Mimicking the online behaviours of people, the course follows a logical flow - starting from the search engine and how to optimise content so the search engine can &ldquo;understand&rdquo; it and including practical advice on how to utilise social media and pay-per-click advertising to gather and drive traffic to your website.
But digital doesn&rsquo;t end with search engines and social media channels, there is more than meets the eye and the course goes in-depth to discuss how to analyse data using web analytics as well as how to plan and launch email and mobile campaigns. It is an all-round primer providing the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo; to anyone who wants to be successful in the digital 21st century.
Advertising Diploma
People often explain digital marketing as just one slice of the marketing pie and using the same logic, advertising is another slice of the same pie, perhaps an even bigger one.
The Advertising Diploma course is a brief overview of traditional advertising, focusing on practical methods and working knowledge.
Strategies, planning and budgeting are the crucial components of a successful advertising campaign and the course explores all of them and more - it also examines what makes an ad go viral as well as the most common mistakes in advertising that should be avoided at all costs.
Finally, the Advertising Diploma looks at the various abbreviations and UK legislation in regards to advertising and discusses the vast opportunities that online and print advertising can offer.
Sales Diploma
Marketing and advertising efforts do pay off and the result is the increased interest from potential clients as they are attracted by your brand and message.
The next and perhaps the most important step is to help them reach the decision to actually buy your product or service by employing a variety of selling techniques.
It has been proven that there must be at least five different contacts with the client before they reach the decision to buy as selling is an art of engagement.
The Sales Diploma gives away the secrets of a successful salesperson in that it shows you the stages of the sales process and teaches you how to overcome objections that stand in the way of the deal.
The Sales Diploma is a practical guide for anyone looking to gain the skills of negotiation and persuasion, the key skills for selling. It also looks at effective ways to write proposals, prospect clients and lead generation.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Commitment to Consistency Course
Many of us are afraid of commitment, regardless of its form.
We may hop from job to job (or relationship to relationship), because we are fearful of the unknown. Some people are forever terrified of commitment, which makes them inconsistent throughout their lives. This can cause them to look undependable and untrustworthy to others around them.
Consistency is the key to making sure that those around you know that you can be trusted and that you care about them.
This course gives you an overview of consistency, why it is important and how commitment is needed to be more consistent. It fully explains what the definitions are for commitment and consistency, why you should be consistent and touches on how to be consistent.
The course also gives examples of people who are consistent and committed - you can easily determine how the two are similar and how they work together to make you a better, more respectable person.
Finally, the course covers the traits needed to be consistent and committed, some of which overlap. That way, you can see where you stand and can determine how to change so that you have all of those traits (and others) based on your desire to be more consistent in life.
You Will Learn:

The definition of commitment and consistency
How to understand the differences and similarities between the two
How to be consistent daily and why you need commitment to do so
The traits of being consistent and committed
How to become more consistent

Benefits of Taking This Course

Learn more about why consistency matters
Learn why it&rsquo;s ok to say no
How to be consistent (set goals, schedule time effectively)
Learn why you must stay committed to consistency; you don&rsquo;t just get consistent and never have to work on it again. You must remain diligent and firm with yourself for consistency to happen over time.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Complaints Handling Course
It is a popular idea that bad news spreads faster than good news.
When a customer encounters a bad service, such a person is most likely to tell ten other people about their bad experiences. Hence, the need for proper complaints handling as a recovery process.
Proper complaints handling allows for a second chance to put things right for your customers. In most cases, the customer is key, and losing one could result in you losing many more. You are expected to carefully listen to the customer, admit your faults, accept responsibility, apologise to them and try to resolve their issues. However, whatever is done to resolve such issues should be acceptable within your company guidelines and policies.
It is imperative to see complaints as opportunities, in order to make customers feel better about your products and services and also generate repeat business.
Another thing to note is that, when complaints are not handled properly, it could make or break your business. In order to avoid this, this course will guide you towards better complaints handling procedures.
You Will Learn About:

Why complaint handling is good for business
The effects of complaint handling on customer satisfaction
How to effectively handle customer complaints
The importance of proper complaints handling

Benefits of Taking This Course Include:

Learning about more effective ways in which to handle complaints
Understanding that failure to properly handle customer complaints may cause customers to boycott your company

      <g:description><![CDATA[Costs and Causes of Employee Turnover Certificate


Employee turnover costs businesses and the economy an astronomical amount of money every year, with some industries particularly vulnerable to its effects. Some turnover is normal and healthy in every sector, but above-average turnover can significantly lower productivity and morale in the workplace. Therefore, it is imperative that every organisation makes an effort to measure and analyse who is leaving – and why.

This course provides an overview of the factors underlying employee turnover and how job and personal factors affect the likelihood that someone will tender their resignation. You will also learn what employers, recruiters and managers across all sectors can do to improve employee retention. You will discover why the first few weeks following a new hire are crucial, the role of training and how to build a positive workplace culture that inspires satisfaction and loyalty among employees.
You Will Learn:-

 	The differences between voluntary and involuntary employee turnover, how it is measured and why high turnover is generally a warning sign that an organisation needs to examine their recruitment and hiring practices.
 	The financial and non-financial toll turnover takes on a business, how it impacts profitability and productivity and why a single resignation can trigger a domino effect within a department.
 	The most common causes of employee turnover, how many employees are unhappy in their roles and what they most value in a prospective employer.
 	Why the recruitment process is instrumental in reducing an organisation’s turnover rate and what employers can do to check the “fit” between a candidate and their organisation.
 	How to improve retention rates among existing staff, nurture talent within an organisation and build a good company culture.

Benefits Of Taking This Course:-

 	If you are in a management position, you will gain useful insight into the relationship between leadership practices and employee retention.
 	If you work in an HR role, this course will provide you with information that will help you measure and understand turnover in your company.
 	If you work in a recruitment-based role, this course will help you draw links between job design, the recruitment process, worker satisfaction and turnover.
 	Anyone who oversees the day-to-day running of an organisation will benefit from understanding the link between employee turnover and the success of the organisation as a whole.
 	Anyone interested in organisational psychology will appreciate this opportunity to learn more about employee motivation.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Costs, Volumes and Profits
The difference between business revenue and costs of operation make up business profits. Sales volumes and the cost of products or services can impact the potential of a business to generate profits. This relationship is explained through cost-volume-profit analysis.

The difference between sales and variable costs or the cost of goods and/or services sold makes up profits. After deducting fixed costs from the gross profit, you are left with income or the net profit. Fixed costs range from rent and interest to insurance and labour costs. They are indirectly related to production of goods and services.

Higher costs lead to lower profits and vice versa. Increasing revenue or lowering costs can increase profits. Improving the efficiency of business operations, reducing the cost of material and cutting on labour can reduce costs. The cuts on costs should not cause a drop in business revenue to increase profits. 

If the sales volumes are higher than variable costs, more profits can be generated. Constant sales volume and revenue with reduced costs can increase profits. This course explains the relationship between costs, volumes and profits through cost-volume-profit analysis. 

We show how changes in prices, margins and unit volumes of products or services can affect a company’s ability to generate profits. Cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis is a critical tool for financial analysis that helps businesses determine their ability to become profitable.

You Will Learn:

	The definition of the terms: costs, volumes and profits

	The relationship between costs, volumes and profits

	How to calculate cost-volume-profit or CVP analysis

	The assumptions made during CVP analysis

	How to calculate contribution margin and contribution margin ratio

	Pound and unit break-even points

	How to create a contribution margin income statement

	The benefits of CVP analysis


Benefits of the Course:

Taking this course will help you:
	Know the relationship between cost, volume and profits

	Know how to calculate CVP analysis

	Know how to use analysis results to increase business profits

	Know the importance of the relationship of cost, volume and profits in business operations

	Know the various benefits of CVP analysis in business

	Learn how to increase profits in your current or future business

      <g:description><![CDATA[Dialectical Behaviour Therapy 
People with borderline personality disorder struggle with pervasive emotion regulation. They are unable to identify their feelings or emotions, lack the skills they need to manage their emotions and often develop problematic behaviours, such as self-harm, suicidal thoughts and substance abuse to help them cope.

Dialectical behaviour therapy was developed to help such people understand the relationship between emotions, thoughts and behaviours. The therapy is based on the notion that changing one of the elements changes the other elements. For instance, changing behaviours also alters related emotions and thoughts, and so on.

Dialectical behaviour therapy or DBT differs from other psychotherapy treatments in many ways. It looks at the patient holistically, using a custom approach that meets their treatment needs. It assesses how an individual’s mental health impacts their problem and vice versa.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Duty of Care

A duty of care is the responsibility to ensure the health, safety and general wellbeing of other people. It can encompass offering constructive feedback and safe working conditions for employees. The UK has a legal obligation for duty of care. People are expected to care about the health and safety of people around them. 

With such provisions in place, working environments in the UK are most often safe for employees. This is unlike workplace environments in developing countries, as they do not have a legal obligation for duty of care. 

Employers must first meet legal obligations to be able to offer an advanced duty of care to their employees. They should also determine what their workers need and the duty of care that is already in place in order to help come up with new duty of care principles.
 
Due to the essence of people’s safety at work or anywhere else, this course has been developed to help you understand the term ‘duty of care’ in a general sense, for ease of application in any industry.
We start by defining duty of care and what it generally involves. 
Next, we list the benefits of duty of care to employees and explain whether it is a legal requirement in the UK. 

Finally, the course covers levels of duty of care and how employers can develop a duty of care policy.

You Will Learn:


	The meaning of duty of care
	The benefits of duty of care
	The legality of duty of care
	Duty of care levels
	How to develop a duty of care policy 



Benefits of Taking This Course:


Taking this course will help you:
	Understand duty of care and its essence in the workplace or anywhere else where it’s applicable 
	Know the benefits of duty of care to employees
	Determine if you need duty of care

Figuring out an ideal reward system is the best way to motivate yourself and others to complete tasks. There are two main types of rewards that people tend to use: extrinsic rewards and intrinsic rewards. 

Understanding the difference between the main two types of rewards and how they can be applied to all situations, including at work and at home, can help you and others to feel more productive. This knowledge also helps you avoid over-rewarding individuals for certain tasks or behaviours, which almost always backfires. 

This course provides you with comprehensive information regarding both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. It begins by explaining extrinsic rewards in detail and moves on to describe intrinsic rewards.

The course then moves on to cover the ways in which you can use extrinsic rewards, in order to motivate yourself and others. 

Finally, the course covers the importance of praise, mentorship, education and feedback.

		When using extrinsic rewards should be done with caution.

		The features that must be present, in order to increase the value of intrinsic rewards.

		How to use extrinsic rewards to motivate, without it backfiring.

The GDPR still applies to the UK despite having now left the EU. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been retained in UK law with only some small changes. The key principles, rights and obligations remain the same. It is now known as the UK GDPR. In this course, 'GDPR' refers to both the EU and UK GDPR. Where the information relates specifically to the UK or EU GDPR, this will be referred to as UK GDPR or EU GDPR.

Over the years, the way companies and organisations collect, use and maintain data has changed dramatically. For example, the electronic storage of data is a relatively new concept and one that has not always been adequately addressed by existing legislation.

With these changes in mind, the European Union (EU) created the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Experts believe that it is one of the most important pieces of data protection legislation drafted within the last 20 years. It is important that everyone involved in the collection, storage and processing of personal data be aware of the GDPR and its implications. This course is an introduction to the scope and purpose of the GDPR.
You Will Learn:

 	What the GDPR is, why it was introduced, when it came into effect, its relationship to previous legislation and who must comply with the new rules.
 	The principles underlying the GDPR, the bases on which an organisation is permitted to collect and process data and how the GDPR makes provision for the handling of highly sensitive personal information.
 	The rights granted to individuals under the GDPR and what this means for organisations who collect and process data.

Benefits of Taking This Course:

 	If your job entails the regular collection, storage or handling of personal data, this course will provide you with an invaluable introduction to your obligations under the GDPR.
 	If you own a business, this course will help you understand when and how you may collect data from clients and consumers and process it in a lawful manner.
 	If you work in a management role, this course will help you advise members of your team with regards to handling and processing consumer data.
 	If you are responsible for implementing data handling and processing policies at your place of work, this course will give you a good starting point from which to draft them.
 	If you are interested in consumer rights and privacy law, the information in this course will be of general interest to you.

Dealing with consumer objections is a huge part of any sales position. Not every customer is going to be easily convinced that your product is best for them, and they may come up with numerous objections to the sale.

Next, we will review the most common types of objections that you can expect to encounter, along with a few quick tips on how to overcome them.

We will also cover more general techniques that can be applied to other types of objections.

Finally, we review ways in which to handle complaints, which are essentially objections from customers, once the sale has been completed.
You will Learn:

 	Why you need to develop credibility early on in the sales process
 	How to overcome misunderstandings and scepticism regarding a product;
 	The importance of asking questions, when dealing with customer objections
 	Why you need to tackle the biggest objection first
 	The role of listening in handling complaints
 	The best strategies to use, when dealing with objections or complaints from existing customers

 	How to create a supportive environment that normalises healthy eating by making changes to company culture, the type and amount of food provided and ensuring that workers who want to change their diets are encouraged to meet their goals.
 	How and why workplace incentives and challenges work alongside education to instil new habits, why it is important to consult with the workforce before implementing new initiatives and why workplace weight loss competitions may not always be a good idea.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Instagram Marketing Certificate
The world of marketing changed exponentially with the introduction of social media. Not only did social media platforms allow for a major expansion in marketing demographic outreach, but it introduced an affordable avenue for businesses and companies to market their brand. 

Since its inception in 2010, Instagram rapidly became a sought-after platform for marketing. As with any form of marketing, Instagram marketing requires research, legwork and a budget. However, the potential to reach the masses is far greater than with any other platform for product marketing, albeit print, digital format or social media.

In this Instagram Marketing course, we will look at the brief history of Instagram to gain a better understanding of how the platform works. 

In addition, we will learn how to effectively use Instagram as a means of domestic and global brand outreach to maximise the potential for success. If used effectively, Instagram marketing may be the only form of marketing that is required for a brand. 

You Will Learn:


        The history of Instagram
        The role that Instagram marketing plays
	The formula for Instagram’s success 
	Defining business goals
	Setting marketing objectives
	How to create a content strategy
	How to define your target market on Instagram
	Instagram marketing challenges
	How to take advantage of Instagram tools
 

In general, marketing requires a good bit of research. It is important to clearly identify a brand and to market the product/service to the right demographic. Although Instagram is a social media platform, it is not exempt from the rules of efficient marketing. Therefore, to be a successful Instagram marketer or to make sure that the right form of marketing is used for a business, communities and users need to be identified.

The latter is particularly important, as it is estimated that 95 million photos and videos are shared via Instagram every day. Therefore, to ensure that a brand is not lost within the sea of many brands and business, the correct target audience needs to be identified.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Is the Customer Always Right?

While customers are undoubtedly the most important asset of any business, the question remains if consumers are indeed always right. Coined by Harrod Gordon in 1909, ‘the customer is always right’ is an old and widely accepted adage in the world of business. However, as crucial as customer satisfaction is and as important as customers are to business success, there are times and situations where consumers are not always right. In fact, blindly following the assumption that consumers are always right can lead to adverse implications. 

The video course on ‘Is the Consumer Always Right?’ discusses and debates both sides of the coin and helps you decide on the best ways to resolve situations at work. 

The course topics cover:

		Why customers are invaluable to the growth and development of your business and how to treat your customers well

		The benefits of treating your customers with attention and respect and how it helps 

		Learning to identify situations where the consumer may not always be right and how to differentiate between the legitimacy of the complaint and poor customer service

		How to weigh the pros and cons of the situation and include important considerations

		How blindly favouring the consumer can lower the morale of your employees

		Useful strategies and tips that you can use when you find that a consumer is not right

		How to determine if you can resolve the situation or if you should let the consumer go

Benefits of studying the course include:

		You will be able to evaluate a situation by gathering details 

		You become aware of the importance of customers and why you should offer reliable customer service

		You are better placed to back up employees when a consumer is abusive or abrasive 

		You learn how to differentiate between solid customers who are worth retaining and others that you can let go

      <g:description><![CDATA[Learning Disabilities Awareness

Learning disabilities are often diagnosed in children after they start school. Although the disorders develop in children at a young age, even before birth, they only manifest in school age children.

Affected children are unable to interpret what they see or hear. They are also not able to connect information from various parts of the brain. The problems manifest as difficulties with written or spoken language, self-control, co-ordination or even attention. 

The difficulties also affect school work and impair learning to write, read or do mathematics. However, an individual’s IQ or the person’s intelligence is not reflected through learning disabilities.

The disorders are often lifelong, impacting an individual’s family situation, work or school, friendships, daily routines or even play. Overlapping learning disabilities can become apparent in children with the disorders. However, some children have just one independent learning issue, which has no effect on other parts of their lives.

Not all learning difficulties fall under learning disabilities. Some children are just slow to develop specific skills because children naturally differ in their rate of development. Therefore, what may seem to be a learning disorder may just be a delay in reaching maturity. 

This course covers everything you need to know about learning disabilities.

You Will Learn:


	 What learning disabilities are and how they occur 
	 Types of learning disabilities
	Signs of learning disabilities in children in their early years, their fifth year and at primary school level
	Signs of learning disabilities in secondary school students and adults
	Interventions for learning disabilities 
	Learning disability awareness months and weeks




Benefits of Taking This Course


Taking this course will help you:
	Understand learning disabilities, how they occur and how they manifest
	Learn the different types of learning disabilities
	Help create awareness about the learning disabilities
	Determine if your child has a learning disability
	Learn how to treat learning disorders

Medical acupuncture is the integration of acupuncture with allied or medical western health practices. Believed to have originated from Europe and Asia, acupuncture is practised in its original and hybrid form.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Mental Health Awareness Certificate
According to the mental health charity Mind, one in four adults experience a mental health problem every year and one in six experience a mental health issue each week. These issues affect people from all walks of life – no one is immune to psychological distress.

Although mental illness is relatively common, sufferers often feel too ashamed to seek help. In some cases, this can have devastating consequences – mental illness diminishes an individual’s quality of life and can even result in suicide.

Fortunately, simply being aware of the signs, causes and treatment can create a safe environment – whether at home or in the workplace – whereby people feel as though they can talk about their problems and access appropriate interventions. This course will provide you with an introduction to the concept of mental illness, the signs and symptoms of the most common mental illnesses and how mental distress can be successfully managed.
You Will Learn:

 	What is meant by the terms “mental health” and “mental illness”, how psychological distress manifests itself and how mental illness impacts a person’s life.
 	The main symptoms of depression, anxiety disorders and panic attacks.
 	The symptoms of schizophrenia, the truth behind common misconceptions surrounding this illness and the nature and impact of psychosis.
 	How medication and talk-based therapies are used in the treatment and management of mental illness, and why some people with mental illness need to stay in hospital on an inpatient basis.
 	How and why people self-harm, the nature of suicidal thoughts and how to help someone who is contemplating ending their own life. 

Benefits Of Taking This Course:

 	You will be in a position to support those experiencing mental illness or psychological distress, both at home and in the workplace.
 	If you are interested in a career supporting those with psychiatric difficulties, this course will provide you with a useful overview of the most common mental health topics.
 	If you work in an HR or management role, this course will provide you with the skills you need to support employees with mental health problems.
 	If you are interested in psychology, this course will give you an insight into the various forms mental illness can take and how it is treated.
 	This course will provide you with background information that will help you make sense of public policy issues relating to mental health.

 	An array of lifestyle factors that you can work on or adapt, to support your mental health, including diet and exercise, relational health and community

      <g:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Excel Advanced]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Excel Advanced Course
Please Note: This course uses the Windows version of Microsoft Office 2016 for content and tests. Any other versions will have some differences in the functions.

The MS Excel Advanced Course is the longest and the most comprehensive of the three Excel courses presented here. However, if you have successfully passed the beginner and the intermediate courses, you should consider yourself fully prepared to begin the advanced course.

Formulas, or functions, are what advanced users of Excel want from this tool. When one uses formulas, not only can they see the data they require for their work, they can also analyse it and get answers to very complex questions. Though any person with a small amount of Excel knowledge can use formulas, such as SUM, a user who has advanced Excel skills will use other formulas, both alone and combined, such as MATCH, INDEX, DSUM and VLOOKUP. In addition to knowing these formulas, those who are advanced users of Excel know how to debug these formulas, how to audit them, and how to choose the perfect formula for the occasion.
What you will learn
Some of the concepts that you will learn in the MS Excel Advance Course include the following:

 	How to set a Password to an Excel document
 	VLOOKUP Advanced formula options and manipulations
 	Other advanced functions including OR, AND, CHOOSE, INDIRECT, REPLACE, LEN, LEFT, FIND
 	Functions including CEILING, CORREL, DATEDIF, DATEVALUE, DAVERAGE and EDATE
 	Colouring a column and row with a formula
 	Highlighting a cell with a formula
 	Functions including ISODD, ISNUMBER, ISTEXT, ISLOGICAL, ISNONTEXT, ISERR and ISBLANK
 	Functions including DGET, DMAX, DPRODUCT, DCOUNTA, DCOUNT and DSUM
 	How to calculate depreciation in Excel, including SLN depreciation and SYD depreciation
 	Calculating loan IPMT and EMI
 	Functions including DATEDIF, DATEVALUE, EDATE, EOMONTH, MATCH and INDEX
 	Full explanation of the INDEX and MATCH functions, covering several modules
 	Looking up data
 	Selecting only cells containing comments
 	Hiding formulas
 	Automatically inserting serial numbers

As you can see, the information you will get from the MS Excel Advanced Course will fully prepare you for virtually any career path, including those that require advanced skills with this software. Once you complete the advanced course, you will have access to the full functionality of Excel, and will know how to use all formulas, functions, and capabilities. Though this course is the longest and most involved of the three, once you complete it, you will have the knowledge and skills that most can only dream of.

This course opens with how to add a password, and also focuses on the VLOOKUP formula, offering several chapters on how to use this function. The course discusses the OR and AND commands, and also focuses on other functions, such as REPLACE, MID, LEFT, and FIND.

You will also learn about calculating depreciation, calculating interest, and even calculating IPMT and EMI for loans, all by using Excel functions. Additionally, the course features information on INDEX and MATCH functions, which is extremely important in certain industries and positions. The course also shows students how to use the CHOOSE formula, and how to create special charts. Finally, the course will show how to automatically enter serial numbers and perform extremely advanced functions.

The advanced Excel course is designed for power users. The general population would not use the information contained within this course, but there are some features taught in the advanced course that can make your Excel usage easier. However, it is recommended that those who take this Excel course continue with the advanced course for a number of reasons. First, getting more knowledge about Excel can help you to master the beginner and intermediate concepts. Additionally, no one has ever lost anything by having more knowledge. You might find that knowing this information will help you in the future, too, as you never know when the organisation you work for might require the services of an Excel expert. These people are paid quite well, and are an invaluable addition to most companies.

Too many people believe that advanced Excel concepts are only useful for those who are interested in programming or concepts such as financial modelling. This, however, is not totally true. The actual truth is that the information contained within this course could be the key to your next promotion or your next job.]]></g:description>

      <g:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Excel for Beginners
Please Note: This course uses the Windows version of Microsoft Office 2016 for content and related tests. Any other versions will have some differences in the functions.

One of the most widely used programs for visualising and analysing data is Microsoft Excel. This software is used in almost every industry, not to mention for personal use in households around the world. Small business owners rely on Excel to track hours, finances, and invoices, and large corporations rely on Excel for data analysis, to visualise data, and innumerable other tasks.

Whether you are brand new to the world of Excel, or you have training and knowledge of the software and are looking to improve your skills, this series of courses can help. By the time you finish the beginner, intermediate and advanced courses, you, too, will be an expert in Excel.

These training videos help you learn at your own pace, as there is no time limit nor deadline to complete the courses. You can also access these courses from any mobile device, including tablets, computers, and mobiles, as long as you have access to the internet.

Since the lessons in this course are only a few minutes each, it makes it very convenient for one to stop and start when necessary. This helps to study when you have time, even if you have less than 20 minutes.

Introduction to the Microsoft Excel for Beginners Course

This beginners course is recommended for anyone who might use Excel at home or at work for uncomplicated reasons, such as tracking simple expenditures or for calculating sums or totals. This course is ideal for anyone who has never used Excel or for those who have only a rudimentary understanding of the software. It is also perfect for anyone who is familiar with the older versions of the software, but not the latest version. If you are re-entering the workforce, you will also find that this course will suit you well, and will certainly get you caught up with your peers.

The course begins with explaining concepts, such as ‘What is a cell?’ and how to tell the difference between a column and a row. The course continues by explaining basic Excel concepts such as how to create, copy, delete, and cut information from Excel cells. You will also learn how to edit information that is put into a cell and how to insert and edit comments when using Excel.

The second half of the beginners Excel overview, which is only a small part of the beginners course, will cover sheets, which is an entirely different concept than cells. In this section, you will learn how to rename a sheet, delete a sheet, hide and unhide a sheet, and move and copy a sheet. You will also learn how to change the colour of tabs.

After mastering the beginners overview, the rest of the beginners course will go further into these concepts, and then teach details on how to perform basic functions.

Each video in the course gives a full explanation of the concept and the instructor visually takes students through each concept step by step on the screen.

When you finish this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to use many of the functions of Excel, and can use the program with ease. You will then be fully prepared to move ahead to the intermediate course.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Motivating Colleagues to Perform Certificate
Employee motivation is at the heart of business success. When employers understand exactly what motivates their workforce, they have the potential to increase not just productivity but also the quality of work, while retaining employees that are happy and satisfied with their jobs.

This may seem obvious but it is surprising how often organisations do not correctly apply the concepts and principles of motivation – missing the immense rewards it can offer, including the immense financial gains. Taking this course will give you the edge against competitors who lack the know how to inspire and maintain motivated action in their organisations.

This course is for employers and leaders that want to get the best performance out of their teams. The content of this course is designed to help both individuals and organisations to understand and confidently apply the skills, tools and techniques to increase motivation in the workplace in a very practical way.

The information is presented in a clear and accessible manner and has incredible potential when applied correctly. You will discover methods to galvanise your team, what to do to avoid counter productive workplace habits, and how to lead your team in the way that will inspire truly sustainable motivation.

This course includes practical tools and strategies to boost and maintain motivation, as well as exercises, tests and other opportunities to assess and apply the knowledge you learn.
What you will learn
You will learn how to:

 	Understand people and what motivates them to work
 	Assess an individual's or team’s level of motivation or demotivation
 	Increase employee motivation and prevent situations which diminish it
 	Create sustainable motivation which is long lasting and highly personal
 	Use different psychological models of motivation utilised by businesses today
 	Modify your leadership to be the most effective for motivating your team

The skills and knowledge you will gain from this course can be applied to any workplace setting and will leave you with a powerful understanding of how to motivate not only others, but also yourself, to achieve the highest levels of performance.

There is an increasing trend for rewarding and motivating work which is personally satisfying.

Leaders need to learn how to successfully motivate their team with intrinsic benefits outside of the usual scope of financial rewards.

Leaders who learn to motivate their team will be rewarded with outstanding results, productivity gains and the personal satisfaction of seeing their team grow. This course delivers everything you need to understand and apply the most successful strategies for motivating anybody to reach their highest potential and deliver the best quality work.]]></g:description>

      <g:description><![CDATA[Noise and Hearing Protection Certificate
One of the most important aspects of health and safety in the workplace is protection from noise hazards. Noise induced hearing loss is described as the most preventable occupational hazard. In the UK, it is estimated that more than one million workers are exposed to noise hazards on a constant basis, thus increasing the risks of permanent hearing loss, reduction in productivity and increased employee absenteeism.

In the course on noise and hearing protection, you have the opportunity to learn about the following topics:-

 	The negative impacts of loud noise levels on health and wellbeing and the different types of noise, including variable, impulse, impact and continuous. You will also learn about Britain’s noise control laws and how employers are legally responsible for noise reduction measures in the workplace.
 	How employers should consider regular risk assessments that help identify sources and the number of people exposed to noise hazards. You will also learn the industrial sectors that are known for higher noise hazard levels.
 	How elimination and isolation of noise hazards helps reduce noise and the important factors such as choosing the right places for machinery, checking for noise emission levels, fixing silencers and grouping together of machinery producing equivalent sounds.
 	How the implementation of administrative controls such as planning activities outside of regular shift hours or outsourcing noise-producing activities to areas situated further away help noise reduction
 	The different types of hearing protectors, including earmuffs and earplugs that help protect workers from noise hazards at work.

Important benefits of learning about noise reduction and hearing protection:-

 	Employers can ensure compliance with UK’s health and safety laws.
 	You have the opportunity to understand how exposure to noise hazards can result in health risks.
 	Employers can consider investing in personal protective equipment, such as specialised earmuffs and earplugs that are suitable to the conditions at work
 	You can implement engineering controls at planning stage to eliminate noise sources, as opposed to making changes later (which usually proves more expensive and less effective).

      <g:description><![CDATA[Play Therapy

Children can be unable to express themselves using words. They lack the verbal and cognitive skills required to fully express themselves and talk about issues that they face. It becomes even worse if the child is suffering from a mental illness or disorder. For instance, grief or anger is complex. A child may not be able to process the feelings and related thoughts, making it difficult for them to deal with the issues.

This is where play therapy comes in. It can help children learn how to deal with mental issues that are causing them distress. Play allows them to act out scenes that are similar to what they may be facing, work on addressing particular issues or even develop characters with similar emotions or feelings as theirs. It is a hands-on therapy.

Children can use toys to express their feelings. For example, a child who has lost a parent or a sibling can use puppets to portray a character that misses a friend and feels sad. A dolls’ house can feature a child beneath their bed, hiding from parents who are fighting, to help a child that has experienced domestic violence.

A therapist can help during play to solve a problem based on the type of approach that is being implemented. The therapist can also simply observe how the child helps the toy character to overcome its emotions.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Prevent Duty
Terrorism is a real and looming threat, and its devastating effects have been experienced time and time again. One of the major tools that terrorist groups use to promote their propaganda and garner support, is the radicalisation of youths and students from a young age. They try to increase their numbers through constant contact, communication and brainwashing of young minds. 

While most children are not attracted to such groups or activities, some may be at higher risk of radicalisation. 

What You Will Learn in This Course:

	How terrorists use intimidation and fear to reach their objectives, and the similarities and differences between terrorists and extremists 


	How terrorist groups use radicalisation of youths to achieve their social, economic and religious ideologies 


	The different methods by which extremist organisations attract new candidates from schools and educational facilities 


	How teachers and school staff can assess risks and observe signs of worrying behaviour 


	What teachers and school staff are expected to do in the event that they notice any cause for concern 


	The CIN provision and how to deal with the situation if a child or group is discovered to be vulnerable to radicalisation 


The Benefits of This Course:

	You will be able to appreciate the strong connection between support for terrorist groups and the radicalisation of youths


	As you understand the signs that indicate risky behaviour, you may be able to identify potentially susceptible children and refer them for help


	You can take proactive steps to create and encourage a positive, empowering environment at school
 

	You can nip in the bud early unacceptable behaviour, including bullying, harassment or discrimination, and prevent the growth of resentment among students 


The Prevent Duty recommendations seek to protect young people from the effects of extremism by promoting inclusivity and encouraging positive debate and discussion.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Project Design Certificate
A project, often purposely designed with an aim to achieve an end goal, relies heavily on its earliest stage of life: the design phase. Key elements such as project description, primary features, goals, outcomes and major deliverables are all identified during the project design stage.

A proper project design can assist in avoiding mistakes and forecasting potential pitfalls. This helps build a strong foundation and better prepares the Project Manager and the team members for unexpected issues.

Additionally, the design phase is crucial in determining the budget or budget estimates. Hence the reason as to why the planning phase is thought to play a vital role in a project’s success.

To implement the necessary elements of a project design, it is important to understand what a successful project design phase looks like.
In this course, we will learn:

 	How to define project goals
 	How to determine outcomes and deliverables
 	How to identify the risks
 	The importance of a visual component

The benefits of this course are:

 	Why defining the project goals is essential to a successful project outcome
 	The ability to determine outcomes and deliverables beforehand to allow for better preparation
 	The ability to identify the risks associated with a project
 	You will learn about the importance of a visual component and the types of visual aids to use to positively support the project

Project design has many benefits, other than ensuring a successful project outcome. It provides people with work and teaches individuals to work together with colleagues to achieve the same end goal.]]></g:description>

      <g:description><![CDATA[Project Development and Testing 

Once a project officially kicks-off, it enters the development stage. This is essentially the phase at which the project begins to slowly materialise, with team members actively working towards achieving the goal. At this point, stakeholders have been consulted, the project has been pitched and accepted, and it is now time to move into the development phase. 

During the development stage, a project will go through its conception, initiation, implementation and follow-up phases. At some point during the development stage, team members will begin to create test scenarios, which will lead into the testing phase. The testing phase is the examination and investigation period of a project, which is intended to inform stakeholders of performance levels and allow them to evaluate potential failure risks. 

In this course, we will identify and study the key aspects that are needed for the successful completion of a project and the importance of project testing. 

What we will learn in this course:

	The phases of project development: initiation, planning, design, execution, implementation, testing and monitoring

	How to develop a project concept

	The importance of time and communication management

	The need for project testing



The benefits of this course are:

	You will understand the phases of project development and testing, which will help in building a proper project plan

	You will learn how to put together a project concept easily and effectively 

	You will learn how to implement a time and communication management plan that will help team members stay on track

	You will understand the importance of project testing and what happens if parts of the project are neglected

Smaller projects are then left without someone in charge, which only invites disorder and chaos. Project management ensures that everything goes smoothly, including the development and delivery of the product to the client.

Effective management can also cut costs and prevent wasted time by focusing on the ultimate goal and taking steps to make it happen. When a team is left without leadership, things can soon become unfocused and disorganised.

The course begins by discussing how to define and plan the project.

We also review the importance of flexibility in project management.

Finally, we let you know how to purchase software programs that you can use to make project management much easier.
You will Learn:

 	How small projects are different to large-scale ones
 	The steps involved in effective small project management
 	The best time to set your budget

 	The qualities you need to learn for your project to run smoothly

      <g:description><![CDATA[Project Preparation Certificate

Project preparation – a term that may sound self-explanatory – has many obvious and not-so-obvious elements that contribute to its successful implementation. However, before learning what proper project preparation entails, it is important to know what it is and the way in which it is crucial for a successful project outcome. 

Project preparation, as implied by its name, is the stage of a project whereby all the planning occurs. If you think about important events, such as vacations, a wedding or when buying a home, all require some sort of planning. This is because a planning phase is crucial in many respects but primarily in regards to achieving project goals. 

Project preparation can include extensive research, preliminary design, developing concepts, identifying operational cost and estimates for capital, as well as sources of funding and consulting stakeholders.

It is always a good idea to do as much research as possible in respect of the project and the industries associated with it. Research is a key component of project planning and helps to create a solid project plan. This not only helps in confidently supporting a claim but also in achieving the end goal, which is the sole purpose of a project. 

A project team and others who are involved in the planning stages should always be kept in the loop in the preparation phase, as they will be able to assist in building a solid successful plan and, ultimately, ensuring a successful project completion. 

What you will Learn in this Course:

		How to identify what a project is, why it’s being initiated and how to define its purpose

		How to identify a project’s stakeholders

		How to identify issues, risks and opportunities 

		The importance of budget estimation and cost management


The Benefits of this Course:

		You will learn about the importance of a project and how crucial it is to define the purpose of a project in the early stages

		You will learn about the importance of stakeholders and how they need to be used as a compass with which to navigate the project

		You will learn how to identify issues and risks, even if they are not that obvious

            You will learn about the importance of budget estimation and cost management, as it will affect the overall scale of your project

      <g:description><![CDATA[Questioning and Listening Techniques Certificate
Questioning and listening skills are pivotal to effective communication and creating mutual understanding. These vital communication tools are requisite for building effective working and personal relationships. Interpersonal communication skills are the foundation of business success and the most highly sought after employees are those who are able to capitalise on these abilities.

Unfortunately, most people have no idea of the importance of communication skills in the workplace. However, research has clearly demonstrated that the ability to accurately communicate requirements, express needs, give and receive feedback and listen with empathy builds confidence and charisma and propels personal development. Conversely, the costs of poor communication are astronomical from both a financial perspective and the cost to morale and productivity.
What you will learn
This practical course will support you to enhance existing skills and develop new ones with expert guidance and supportive exercises. This course will guide you through the process of understanding and implementing these highly prized communication skills.  You will rapidly learn how to communicate more effectively with those around you and vitally deepen your understanding about the causes and consequences of costly miscommunications.

In addition to teaching you about the significance of quality communication, in everyday personal and business activities, this course will deliver focused and actionable advice which you can easily implement in all areas of your life. You will delve into the often hidden meanings buried in confusing communications and gain new insight into the emotional nature of expression.

This course focuses specifically on the two most significant areas of communication: the skills of listening and questioning. The secret of listening is far from obvious and without in-depth study many people merely scrape the surface of this valuable skill. In addition to learning how to get the most from colleagues, employers and personal relationships learning to actively and reflectively listen will reveal previously unavailable information and insights.

The root cause of the breakdown of many personal relationships, including marriages, is cited as being poor communication. Specifically this is the inability to effectively listen – many divorces could be prevented if couples learned how to really hear each other on a practical and emotional level.

Effective questioning is another valuable tool which will enable you to find and analyse the information that others hold. Knowing how to accurately and effectively ask various types of questions, and under which contexts, will minimise the effort and maximise the results in your interpersonal interactions. This course will also teach you techniques to enhance your understanding of the information you receive to ensure clarity and prevent ambiguity.

Feedback is another skill which you will learn; specifically you will receive guidance and undertake exercises to facilitate effective and honest feedback without the emotional ‘sting’.

Racial discrimination exists in schools and offices and affects diverse populations in many ways. It not only affects mental, emotional and physical wellbeing but also impacts other spheres of life. As a nation, the UK stands to benefit greatly by harnessing the talents of ethnic minorities and ensuring that every individual is treated with respect and dignity.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Spanish – Level 1
Learning Spanish gives you access to hundreds of millions of Spanish speakers across the globe. As one of the liveliest cultures and most spoken Romance languages, Spanish is a useful and fun language to learn. For English speakers, or speakers of other Romance languages like French, Italian and Portuguese, it’s one of the easiest languages to learn. Spanish has a similar structure to the other Romance languages and is considered to be even simpler than English. Starting off with Level 1 Spanish is the perfect way to remind you of the small amount of Spanish you probably already know and expand on your skills and vocabulary further from there.
You Will Learn:

 	The Spanish alphabet as well as the important characteristics of the language
 	Some of the most used Spanish verbs such as studying, working and living - as well as the proper conjugations of each one
 	How to carry a basic conversation in Spanish and ask about topics like work, food, and preferences
 	How to use prepositions, pronouns, and conjunctions in Spanish
 	Throughout the modules, you will pick up hundreds of useful vocabulary words and have the chance to practise them repeatedly

Benefits of Taking This Course:

 	Gain a wide and useful repertoire of Spanish vocabulary and phrases that will help you gain a conversational ability
 	Start off your Spanish education with modules designed to help you absorb and remember as much information as possible
 	You will be equipped with the most common verbs, a basic knowledge of sentence structure and grammar, as well as a wide array of Spanish vocabulary.
 	Learn about what sets Spanish apart from other languages, what its main characteristics are, and how the Spanish alphabet works
 	Complete Level 1 with the confidence to speak, write, and understand Spanish in any setting

Spanish – Level 2
Spanish is a useful language for anyone to learn. Spoken in high concentrations in Mexico, the U.S., Spain and South America, Spanish has become one of the most spoken languages in the entire world. Not to mention, it’s one of the easiest languages for native English speakers to learn. Many English speakers already have a working knowledge of Spanish simply because of the thousands of similar words between the two languages. If you already know some Spanish, or you’ve completed Level 1, but want to take your skills and fluency to the next level, Level 2 Spanish is the perfect fit.

Having a mastery of Spanish is a huge benefit for those who enjoy traveling, conduct business in Spanish-speaking countries, or simply want to learn a new language for fun. Level 2 focuses on expanding your Spanish skills, helping you dive deeper into the form and function of the language, and adding plenty of new words to your vocabulary. Practice is the key to truly becoming fluent in any language, and Level 2 offers the perfect opportunity to practise your Spanish skills and slowly increase how easy it is to converse in the language.
You Will Learn:

 	How to describe people and things
 	How to introduce yourself, talk about your life, and ask questions about other people
 	Several more important verbs in Spanish as well as how to use and conjugate them properly
 	The most used verb tenses in Spanish
 	Speaking about new topics like seasons, times, cities, and languages

Benefits of Taking This Course:

 	Master your conversational Spanish skills while adding new vocabulary to your repertoire
 	Learn more about Spanish and Hispanic culture
 	Become more confident in your Spanish abilities
 	Complete Level 2 with a newfound fluency in Spanish, as well as an ability to speak, write, and read in Spanish

      <g:description><![CDATA[Stepladder Safety Course Description

Workplace accidents can have serious consequences for both the casualty and their organisation. It is important that both employees and their employers understand the risks associated with working from height and that they know how to use equipment in a safe, appropriate manner. An individual can sustain an injury falling just a couple of metres. They can also suffer a back injury if they fail to take precautions when moving and positioning equipment. 

Stepladders are used frequently in the workplace, so it is essential that employees know when and how to use them. This course will provide you with a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with stepladders, how to put in place effective precautionary measures and how to ensure that equipment is fit for purpose. Not all accidents are preventable, but when everyone knows how to work safely, the majority of incidents can be avoided.

	Why you need to take the risk of accidents and injury seriously and why the proper use of stepladders should be of concern to all employees and employers.
	How to assess whether a stepladder is the most appropriate form of equipment for a task and the factors you must take into consideration when conducting a risk assessment.
	How to check that a stepladder is fit for purpose, how to spot the signs that indicate it should be withdrawn from use and how to ensure that a faulty piece of equipment is not used by mistake.
	What you need to remember when working with a stepladder, including how to position your body and work effectively with tools whilst carrying out a task.
	How to move and store a stepladder safely and securely, taking into account its material, intended purpose and points of structural vulnerability.




Benefits Of Taking This Course:


	You will be able to use a stepladder confidently and safely, both at home and in the workplace.

	You will have a greater understanding of health and safety concerns at work, which is especially beneficial if you are in a management or HR role.

Further, it explores the rules, regulations and taxes for trading internationally as well as exporting and importing to and from the UK.

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Art of Persuasion Certificate

The art of persuasion is a difficult one to master but is an invaluable skill to possess. No one wants to be forced to use coercion or aggressive tactics to get their point across or to find common ground on an issue. Persuasion is based on reasoning and understanding rather than hostility or threats, making it the best way to convince your conversation partner that you are right or that your way of doing things is the preferred one. 

This course goes into detail about how you can develop your own persuasive skills. By practising these skills, you may find that you master the art of persuasion in very little time. 

We begin by discussing the way human behaviour is often motivated.

Next, we move on to discuss Aristotle’s persuasive techniques - ones that are still very relevant today. 

Finally, we leave you with the steps you should take to ensure that your argument is persuasive. These steps work well in both speech and the written word, making them ideal for essay writers and presenters alike. 

You Will Learn:


	The five main influencers of human behaviour and how you should respond to them
	The four modes of persuasion and how they can be applied today
	Information on how those persuasive techniques can be used for good or bad intentions 
	How to use Monroe’s Motivated Sequence to your advantage 



Benefits of Taking This Course: 


	Learning how to become more persuasive in your everyday life without resorting to aggression  
	Being able to participate in more productive conversations
	Understanding why people tend to display the habits they do
	Learning how to use simple persuasive techniques in your everyday speech 
	Learning how to construct a persuasive argument in just a few simple steps

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Advanced Human Resources Diploma
HR professionals need to be familiar with laws governing common HR functions, such as managing employee sick leave and dealing with grievances. Failure to deal with HR issues in a timely manner can lower employee morale, impair productivity, increase turnover, drive up costs and even result in legal action. An ineffective HR department can also damage a company’s reputation.

This bundle addresses key HR functions and how to handle challenges familiar to all HR professionals. These courses offer practical guidance to help you deal with sensitive matters in a tactful manner, bring disputes to a satisfactory close, clarify employees’ responsibilities and job roles, and help employees achieve a work-life balance.
What You Will Learn
This combined course includes the following:

 	Introduction to Contracts of Employment Certificate
 	Discipline &amp; Grievance Certificate
 	Parental Rights Certificate
 	Sick Leave Certificate

Introduction to Contracts of Employment Certificate
When a new employee starts their job with a company, both parties will rely on a contract of employment to outline the terms and conditions governing the nature of the work and the rate of compensation. Contracts do not have to be written on paper, but it is common practice to draw up a formal written document.
In this course, you will learn what should be covered in a contract of employment, the details an employer must report to HMRC when a new worker starts with their company and how the PAYE system facilitates payment for work completed. The course also addresses the impact of a worker’s status on the content of a contract and what happens if either party breaches the terms and conditions.

Discipline &amp; Grievance Certificate
When an employee breaches the terms and conditions of their employment or raises a grievance at work, it is the employer’s responsibility to abide by their company’s discipline and grievance policies. Consistent and fair disciplinary protocols are essential in the maintenance of a pleasant and productive working environment.

In this course, you will learn how to adopt a progressive approach to workplace discipline, how to conduct an appropriate and balanced disciplinary hearing, how to draw up fair policies, how to manage grievances on a formal and informal basis, and how to audit your procedures. You will learn how to adopt a proactive approach that will help resolve problems early on.
Parental Rights Certificate
The majority of employees will have at least one child at some point during their working lives, making parental rights a key issue for businesses. UK workers can elect to take Maternity, Paternity, Adoption and Shared Parental Leave. They are usually eligible for paid and unpaid leave.

In this course, you will learn about employee entitlement and employer obligations under the law with regards to parental leave. The course will provide you with an overview of the benefits available to parents, how to calculate pay and time off work and the circumstances in which they can take unplanned, unpaid leave to care for close family members.
Sick Leave Certificate
All employees will fall sick from time to time, so every employer needs to be aware of the laws governing sick pay, self-certification, sick leave. They also need to be aware of best practices when welcoming an employee back to work.

In this course, you will develop an understanding of how Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) works and how much an employee is entitled to receive. You will learn how and when someone can self-certify and the role of “fit notes” in coordinating SSP and sick leave. The course addresses the sensitive issue of dismissal following ill health and offers guidance on making reasonable adjustments for employees returning to work.

      <g:title><![CDATA[The Complete Child Protection and Safeguarding Diploma]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Child Protection and Safeguarding Diploma
All children deserve to live free from fear of mistreatment, neglect and abuse. Unfortunately, thousands of UK children are exploited and abused on a daily basis. Anyone working with children must understand how abuse occurs, how to identify the signs and what to do if you suspect a child is a victim of abuse. This bundle will equip you with this knowledge, allowing you to safeguard children in your care.

If you work in a school, you also need to know how to physically intervene during a serious incident, without violating the child’s rights or compromising their wellbeing. This bundle will help you understand and implement positive handling in a safe, responsible manner.
What You Will Learn
This combined course includes the following:

 	Child Neglect
 	Child Protection
 	Child Protection In Sport
 	Child Sexual Exploitation
 	Positive Handling In Schools
 	Safeguarding Children

&nbsp;
Child Neglect
Almost 10% of UK children have experienced, or are currently experiencing, neglect. Neglect can have a profound negative impact on physical, emotional and social development. It can be difficult to identify, especially if the child has become adept at concealing it.

In this course, you will learn about the different forms of neglect, the risk factors that increase a child’s risk of neglect and the signs associated with each type of neglect. You will discover what you should do if you learn that a child is being neglected and how to report any concerns to the authorities.
Child Protection
Anyone who works with children has a legal obligation to remain vigilant in detecting and reporting abuse. In short, they must do all they can to protect children from harm. This course includes an overview of the laws designed to protect children and how these translate into everyday practice.

You will learn about the rights of children, as outlined in UK law and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The course explains how the safeguarding process works, the various forms of abuse children suffer and what parents and professionals can do if they suspect abuse.
Child Protection In Sport
If you work in the sports or leisure industries, you may have extensive contact with children and young people. This means that you have important child protection responsibilities. You need to know how to keep children safe from bullying and abuse and how to ensure that sport remains an enjoyable, healthy activity for all children in your care.

This course outlines the risks confronting children today, including bullying and radicalisation. You will learn how good administration practices can keep children safe, how to handle disclosure by a child and how to report abuse.
Child Sexual Exploitation
Thousands of UK children are at risk of sexual exploitation. Anyone who works with children and young people must be alert to the dangers and signs of sexual abuse. Often, a perpetrator is someone in a position of trust, although it is increasingly important to be aware of online exploitation and grooming.

This course outlines how and why perpetrators exploit children in this way and how to identify warning signs that a child is being subjected to sexual abuse. You will learn how a child’s behaviour and appearance can alert you to the possibility of abuse and how to respond to reports and allegations of exploitation.
Positive Handling In Schools
Student aggression and violence is a widespread concern in the education sector. Aggressive students may threaten the safety of others, property and themselves. When used appropriately, positive handling is an effective approach that facilitates speedy resolution of tense situations.

You learn what positive handling means and when it should be used. The course addresses the role of the SCARF model in defusing a situation and how the aggression curve can help you decide on the best course of action. It refers to UK legislation and government guidelines that help you judge when and how to intervene.
Safeguarding Children
Child abuse has a significant negative impact on an individual’s physical and emotional health. Trauma resulting from abuse can affect victims well into adulthood. Safeguarding offers a useful framework that helps you understand how and why abuse occurs and how everyone can work together to prevent it.

You will learn about the various forms of child abuse and who is most likely to abuse a child. You will learn how to spot the signs that a child is being mistreated, how to report abuse and how to engage with a child who has been victimised.

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Customer Service Diploma
In an age of increasing competition, outstanding customer service has never been more important. Your customers expect you to take care of their wants and needs at every step of the buying journey.

In this bundle, you will learn how to understand and communicate with customers across several different platforms, including email and telephone. You will discover how to placate difficult customers, hone your communication skills to resolve problems and ensure that they return in the future.

Delivering a high-quality service can be challenging. These courses acknowledge the realities that come with dealing with customers on a day-to-day basis and will allow you to approach your role with confidence. You will discover how best to handle confrontation, which will reduce your stress levels at work.
What You Will Learn
This combined course includes the following:

 	Caring For Customers’ Needs Certificate
 	Communication Basics Certificate
 	Customer Retention Certificate
 	Electronic Customer Service Certificate
 	Email Etiquette Certificate
 	Face to Face Customer Service Certification
 	Rescuing Difficult Customers Certificate
 	Telephone Customer Service Certificate

Caring For Customers’ Needs Certificate
To win over their customers, a business needs to consistently meet – and ideally, exceed – their expectations. Customers expect that the companies with which they do business will take an active interest in their needs, respond to their feedback and take proactive steps in solving their problems.

However, consistently catering to customer demands requires a considerable level of skill. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the skills you need to build a strong rapport with customers that will foster their loyalty and improve your sales.
Communication Basics Certificate
Communication is the art of transmitting and receiving messages, whether verbally or via body language. It’s essential for your success in the workplace, because it forms the basis of positive business relationships.

However, lots of us struggle to understand what other people are saying, which can result in misunderstandings. With regards to customer service, communication is key in order to appreciate a customer’s needs and problems.

This course will teach you the basic theory underlying good communication and show you how you can harness them to improve relationships with customers.
Customer Retention Certificate
It is easier to sell products and services to existing customers than it is to recruit new ones, so it’s in every business’ best interest to learn the art of client retention.

If you work in a customer service role, you need to understand how to discuss and resolve any grievances. A dissatisfied customer is unlikely to make future purchases and, if they feel particularly unhappy, can have a detrimental effect on your reputation.

This course will provide you with an insight into how successful companies work with customers to resolve problems and how your attitude has a direct bearing on the outcome of a tense situation.
Electronic Customer Service Certificate
These days, most customers expect businesses to provide some form of electronic customer service. This usually takes the form of email, although live chat is becoming increasingly common. Electronic customer service allows you to keep a paper trail of interactions with customers, which is useful in the event of a dispute.

To offer the best possible electronic customer service experience, you need a solid grasp of netiquette, written communication and the general rules that underlie customer service. This course will show you how these pillars fit together.
Email Etiquette Certificate
If you are offering electronic customer service, you will need to master the art of communicating via email. Although email is relatively simple to use, you need to observe standard email etiquette to avoid offending or frustrating your customers.

In this course, you will learn how to write and process emails in a professional manner that presents your business in a positive light.
Face to Face Customer Service Certification
Even in this digital era, face to face customer service remains an essential skill for workers in many industries. You may need to provide customer support, resolve a complaint, or discuss the best solution for their needs. In order to provide them with a good experience, you will need to use verbal and non-verbal communication skills to understand their perspective.

This course will show you how to use your tone of voice, body language and other cues to ensure smooth, productive interactions with all your customers.
Rescuing Difficult Customers Certificate
No matter how efficient your business, you will occasionally have to work with dissatisfied customers who have a problem with a product or service. Unfortunately, some of these customers may be impolite or even hostile. You may have heard these people described as “difficult customers,” and dealing with them requires a special set of skills.

This course will help you develop the communication skills, attitude and demeanour necessary to ensure a positive outcome. You will learn how to detect and manage interpersonal tension, minimising both your stress levels and those of your customers.
Telephone Customer Service Certificate
When delivering telephone-based customer service, you will need to demonstrate strong verbal communication skills – you cannot rely on non-verbal cues and you do not have the time to write a carefully-considered email or chat response.

Telephone customer service may be the only point of contact for customers, so it is imperative that all employees of a business know how to conduct themselves in a professional manner on the telephone. This course will help you and your colleagues identify customer needs, take a proactive approach to customer service and work with them to discover the best solution.

      <g:title><![CDATA[The Complete Fraud Awareness Diploma]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Fraud Awareness Diploma
Fraud is a serious crime that has far-reaching implications for everyone in the country. It can ruin your credit rating, lead to impersonation attempts online, and even bankrupt businesses. In fact, the overall cost of fraud in the UK is nearly £200 billion per year. Everyday citizens, employees, managers and CEOs all need to be armed with the knowledge to reduce the devastating impact fraud can have.

This course bundle includes everything you need to know about fraud, beginning with the behavioural cues and other signs that may indicate fraud is occurring. Progressing through the bundle gives you essential information about your rights, responsibilities and obligations when it comes to prevention, detection and reporting suspicious activity.

Other related topics include identity theft and money laundering, two crimes that are on the rise across the globe. If you are searching for ways to protect yourself, your company and your staff from the harmful effects of fraud, this bundle is for you.
You Will Learn:
This fraud course bundle includes:

 	Fraud Detection
 	Fundamental Concepts Fraud
 	Global Anti-Bribery
 	HMT Sanctions List
 	Human Element of Fraud
 	ID Theft
 	Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism
 	What is Money Laundering?

Fraud Detection
There are two main ways that a company can protect itself against fraud: putting preventive measures in place and having a comprehensive fraud detection programme. This course gives you everything you need to know about fraud detection, including practical tips you can put into practice at your place of work, regardless of your specific industry.
Fundamental Concepts Fraud
While fraud is a common crime, the fundamental concepts behind it are less understood. This is to the detriment of many organisations, as the existence of fraud can be incredibly destructive. This course goes over the important elements you need to know about fraud to stay safe, including the categories of fraud, the points at which fraud is likely to occur, and what to do if you suspect it is happening at your company.
Global Anti-Bribery
Another unethical and illegal business practice that is unfortunately common is bribery. While there are legal consequences for those engaged in this practice, they can only work if others in the business world understand the rules and policies relating to this crime. This course reviews global anti-bribery practices and legislation in detail, giving you the tools you need to spot warning signs and continue running an ethical company.
HMT Sanctions List
UK companies are prohibited from doing business with countries, individuals, and organisations contained on the HMT Sanctions List. However, compliance with the legislation behind the list can only be done if you are fully informed of its contents. This course goes over the Sanctions List in detail, explaining why those bans are in place and what the consequences are if you violate those terms.
Human Element of Fraud
Organisations can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, on fraud detection and prevention. However, one of the most successful strategies is also the least expensive: examining the human element. This course reviews the possible motives for fraud, while also talking about how to identify fraudulent activity by paying close attention to human behaviour.
ID Theft
Identity theft is a shockingly common crime – one that can impact you years after the fact. Not only can it destroy your credit, becoming a victim can even make it harder to land your dream job or get an amazing apartment. Understanding the steps you should take to protect yourself as well as the signs that may mean you have been victimised are just two of the key topics covered by this course.
Proceeds of Crime and Terrorism
The UK has developed multiple pieces of legislation designed to fight terrorism and money laundering. All companies, regardless of industry, have specific reporting rules that must be followed. Learn how to comply with the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Terrorism Act while protecting your company from unethical practices by taking this in-depth course.
What is Money Laundering?
Money laundering is the process of making money obtained through illegal means seem legitimate. It is one of the most common forms of fraud, with a huge impact on the financial industry. Learn more about this serious crime, including the steps criminals take when laundering their cash, by taking this course.
Benefits of Taking This Course

Communication Barriers in the Workplace
Effective communication is the glue that holds workplaces together. It ensures that your staff members get along well with members of management, your customers and each other. Obstacles to effective communication can quickly lead to confusion, chaos and conflict. This course gives you the tools you need to understand and work through any barriers to effective workplace communication.
Communication Basics
Both your career path and everyday workplace performance depend on your communication skills. For you to get ahead, you need to be sure that everyone from your managers to your colleagues to your staff members can understand your messages – when delivered verbally as well as in writing. Gain valuable insight into basic communication models and learn how to develop your own listening, speaking and body language skills.
Constructive Feedback
Being able to deliver and receive constructive feedback is a skill that can take you far in life, especially when it comes to your career. Unfortunately, this is not a skill that most people are born with, and it does take time to develop. It is worth working on, as constructive feedback can improve your own performance as well as strengthen your workplace as a whole. This course reviews the importance of this kind of feedback and gives you steps you can follow to perfect your own skills.

Listening Skills
Good communication skills involve more than just getting your own message across to others. In order to communicate well, you must also have perfected your listening skills.

Learn more about how to develop your own listening skills by taking this course.
Tackling Sensitive Conversations

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Level 2 Sales Diploma
While the definition of sales is fairly simple, the process involved is incredibly complex.

 	How to Close More Sales

 	Managing a Sales team
 	Negotiating and the Three Ps

&nbsp;
How to Close More Sales
There is a lot that goes into closing a sale, including developing a relationship with your potential client, figuring out the right way to approach your sales conversation and learning how to present a solution to your client’s expressed or unexpressed problems. This course gives you insight into tried, tested and successful techniques used by salespeople across the globe to seal their own deal fast.
Identifying and Exceeding Customer Needs
If you want your business to stand out, it isn’t enough to have the best products or services on the market. You need to know how to identify the needs of your customers and show them that your company is the best one for them. Then, you have to go the extra mile and exceed all of their expectations. This course breaks down that difficult task into manageable, easy-to-follow steps.
Making an Impression Every Time
Sociologists theorise that we only have about 30 seconds to make an impression on someone for the first time. And since it is exceptionally hard to change a person’s first impression, making a good one matters. This is particularly true in sales, where you are competing against numerous other people and brands for the same customer. This course gives you the skills you need to impress your customers the moment you meet.
Managing a Sales Team
A team can only be as successful as its leader, making it extremely important for your own bottom-line as well as the success of your company as a whole to learn how to effectively manage a team. Learn more about your role, your responsibilities and how to build a strong, cohesive sales team.
Negotiating and the Three Ps
Another key part of the sales process is being able to negotiate successfully with your prospective client. There is a fine art to balancing your customer’s wants, needs and budget with your company’s sales goals. This course reviews everything you need to know to negotiate well and with ease in any sales setting.
Sales Talk – Understanding Jargon
Just like the legal industry has its own jargon, so too does sales. If you are new to the industry, the sheer volume of sales-specific terms may seem overwhelming. And once you do figure the language out, you then have to learn which moments are appropriate for jargon and which are not. Learn the lingo and when to use it, by taking this comprehensive course.
Sales Tools and Technology
Technology has influenced every area of our lives, including the sales process. Understanding which technological tools to use and which you can safely ignore is a key part of staying ahead of the competition. This course reviews the most common sales tools and technology, providing you with practical tips you can use to incorporate technology into your own sales process with ease.
The Sales Pitch
One of the first skills you need to perfect if you want to succeed in sales is how to make a convincing pitch. If you aren’t able to connect with your prospective clients, working with them to understand their needs, you aren’t able to find workable solutions. As a result, you are going to lose the client to a competitor who has those skills. Learn how to build a rapport with your clients, read their needs and craft a compelling pitch.
Writing Sales Proposals
Your written sales proposal is a key aspect of your overall sales pitch, especially if you are competing against other companies for the same contract or project. One missed comma or typo could alter the meaning of the entire document or make your company seem unprofessional. This course walks you through everything you need to know in order to craft persuasive and professional proposals.

      <g:title><![CDATA[The Complete Microsoft Excel Course]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Microsoft Excel Course
Please Note: This course uses the Windows version of Microsoft Office 2016 for content and all related tests. Any other versions will have some differences in the functions.

One of the most widely used programs in the world for visualising and analysing data is Microsoft Excel. This software is used in almost every industry, not to mention for personal use in households around the world. Small business owners rely on Excel to track hours, finances and invoices and large corporations rely on Excel for data analysis, to visualise data and innumerable other tasks.

Whether you are brand new to the world of Excel or you have training and knowledge of the software and are looking to improve your skills, this series of courses can help. By the time you finish the beginner, intermediate and advanced courses, you, too, will be an expert in Excel.

There is no time limit or deadline to complete the courses. You can access these courses from any mobile device, including tablets, computers and mobiles, as long as you have access to the internet.

Since the lessons in this course are only a few minutes each, it makes it very convenient to stop and start when necessary. This helps to study when you have time, even if you have less than 10 minutes or 15 minutes.

The following is an overview of each of the three Excel courses:
MS Excel Beginners Course
The MS Excel beginners course will give you a full overview of all of the most common features of Excel and how to use them.

Some of the highlights of this course include:

 	A basic overview of Excel
 	Calculating sums, averages and totals
 	Counting cells
 	Learning formulas, such as IF, COUNTIF, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP and AVERAGEIF
 	Pivot tables
 	Inserting, editing and deleting comments
 	Creating borders
 	Wrapping text
 	Merging cells
 	Pasting, sorting and converting columns to rows
 	Creating graphs and charts
 	Using the dictionary

This beginners course is recommended for anyone who might use Excel at home or at work for uncomplicated reasons, such as tracking simple expenditures or for calculating sums or totals. This course is ideal for anyone who has never used Excel or for those who have only a rudimentary understanding of the software. It is also perfect for anyone who is familiar with the older versions of the software, but not the latest version. If you are re-entering the workforce, you will also find that this course will suit you well and will certainly get you caught up with the rest of your peers.

The course begins with explaining concepts, such as ‘What is a cell?’ and how to tell the difference between a column and a row. The course continues by explaining basic Excel concepts such as how to create, copy, delete and cut information from Excel cells. You will also learn how to edit information that is put into a cell and how to insert and edit comments when using Excel.

The second half of the beginner’s Excel overview, which is only a small part of the beginner’s course, will cover sheets, which is an entirely different concept than cells. In this section, you will learn how to rename a sheet, delete a sheet, hide and unhide a sheet and move and copy a sheet. You will also learn how to change the colour of tabs.

After mastering the beginner’s overview, the rest of the beginner course will go further into these concepts and then teach details on how to perform basic functions.

Each video in the course shows where one can learn more about the concept covered in the course, as well as the difficulty level of the concept. There is also a full explanation of the concept and the instructor of the course visually takes students through each concept step by step on the screen.

When you finish this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to use many of the functions of Excel and use the program with ease. You will then be fully prepared to move ahead to the intermediate course.
MS Excel Intermediate Course
The MS Excel Intermediate Course will take what you learnt in the beginner course and expand upon it. Additionally, this course will teach you more advanced concepts than those that were presented in the beginner course.

Some of the highlights of the intermediate Excel course include the following:

 	Learning more about intermediate Excel functions including ABS, SUMIF, HLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, AVERAGEIFS and AVERAGEA
 	Data validation with date, list, time and numbers
 	Functions such as RANK, MIN, MAX, CHAR, MODE, MEDIAN, CODE, CLEAN and EXACT
 	How to remove duplicates in Excel
 	Creating random numbers
 	Changing text case
 	Adding custom backgrounds
 	Zooming in and out of Excel
 	How to auto fill data
 	Adding special characters
 	Changing border colour and theme

Before jumping into the MS Excel Intermediate course, one should have a good basic overview of the beginner Excel functions. Those with experience in Excel might feel as if they can skip the beginner course, but it is best to at least go through the course and review it before starting the intermediate curriculum.

Like the beginner course, the intermediate course is set up into short modules and you can watch the module videos on any device that can connect to the internet. The curriculum in the intermediate course is designed for those who work with Excel in the workplace and it is primarily for those who want to improve their skills with this program. There is a lot of useful information found in this course and these skills are necessary for anyone who is going into investments, banking or consulting and will also be useful for administrators or for those who track or analyse a lot of data. If you are someone who is new to the workforce, you, too, will find that employers are looking for candidates with at least intermediate Excel skills.

The first several modules of the intermediate Excel course teaches students how to use formulas, including HLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, COUNTIF and ABS. Data validation information follows this and students work through several modules, each of which are focused on a type of data validation, such as date, list and time. The course continues with more information on specific formulas, which include CHAR, CODE, MEDIAN, MODE and ROUND. Additional information is given on how to manipulate these formulas to meet your needs as an Excel user.

Other information in the MS Excel Intermediate Course includes how to change the text in Excel, i.e. changing text to all upper case or lower case. You will also learn how to change the background and add a custom image and information on auto-filling in Excel. Finally, this course will teach students how to use AutoFill, how to insert special characters and how to draw borders.

Upon completion of this course, you will know about most of the functions that Excel has and how to use this software at an intermediate level. Additionally, you will have the skills necessary to use Excel in most business environments. You will also be fully prepared to begin the MS Excel Advanced Course.
Microsoft Excel Advanced Course
The MS Excel Advanced Course is the longest and the most comprehensive of the three Excel courses presented here. However, if you have successfully passed the beginner and the intermediate courses, you should consider yourself fully prepared to begin the advanced course.

Formulas, or functions, are what advanced users of Excel want from this tool. When one uses formulas, not only can they see the data they require for their work, they can also analyse it and get answers to very complex questions. Though any person with a small amount of Excel knowledge can use formulas, such as SUM, a user who has advanced Excel skills will use other formulas, both alone and combined, such as MATCH, INDEX, DSUM and VLOOKUP. In addition to knowing these formulas, those who are advanced users of Excel know how to debug these formulas, how to audit them and how to choose the perfect formula for the occasion.
What you will learn
Some of the concepts that you will learn in the MS Excel Advance Course include the following:

 	Add a Password
 	VLOOKUP Advanced formula options and manipulations
 	Other advanced functions including OR, AND, CHOOSE, INDIRECT, REPLACE, LEN, LEFT, FIND
 	Functions including CEILING, CORREL, DATEDIF, DATEVALUE, DAVERAGE and EDATE
 	Colouring a column and row with a formula
 	Highlighting a cell with a formula
 	Functions including ISODD, ISNUMBER, ISTEXT, ISLOGICAL, ISNONTEXT, ISERR and ISBLANK
 	Functions including DGET, DMAX, DPRODUCT, DCOUNTA, DCOUNT and DSUM
 	How to calculate depreciation in Excel, including SLN depreciation and SYD depreciation
 	Calculating loan IPMT and EMI
 	Functions including DATEDIF, DATEVALUE, EDATE, EOMONTH, MATCH and INDEX
 	Full explanation of the INDEX and MATCH functions, covering several modules
 	Looking up data
 	Selecting only cells containing comments
 	Hiding formulas
 	Automatically inserting serial numbers

As you can see, the information you will get from the MS Excel Advanced Course will fully prepare you for virtually any career path, including those that require advanced skills with this software. Once you complete the advanced course, you will have access to the full functionality of Excel and will know how to use all formulas, functions and capabilities. Though this course is the longest and most involved of the three, once you complete it, you will have the knowledge and skills that most can only dream of.

This course opens with a focus on the VLOOKUP formula and several modules teach students how to use this function in their work. The course continues with modules on the OR and AND commands and then focuses on other functions, such as REPLACE, LEN, LEFT and FIND.

You will also learn about calculating depreciation, calculating interest and even calculating IPMT and EMI for loans, all by using Excel functions. Additionally, the course features information on INDEX and MATCH functions, which is extremely important in certain industries and positions. The course also shows students how to use the CHOOSE formula and how to create special charts. Finally, the course will show how to automatically enter serial numbers and perform extremely advanced functions.

The advanced Excel course is designed for power users. The general population would not use the information contained within this course, but there are some features taught in the advanced course that can make your Excel usage easier. However, it is recommended that those who take this Excel course continue with the advanced course for a number of reasons. First, getting more knowledge about Excel can help you to master the beginner and intermediate concepts. Additionally, no one has ever lost anything by having more knowledge. You might find that knowing this information will help you in the future, too, as you never know when the organisation you work for might require the services of an Excel expert. These people are paid quite well and are an invaluable addition to most companies.

Too many people believe that advanced Excel concepts are only useful for those who are interested in programming or concepts such as financial modelling. This, however, is not totally true. The actual truth is that the information contained within this course could be the key to your next promotion or your next job.

All three of these courses are designed to improve the knowledge you have with Excel, no matter if you are a beginner, intermediate, or an advanced user. Since these courses are divided into sections, you will also find that they are convenient and it is possible to learn and study during your free time. Additionally, as the modules in the courses are only a few minutes long, for the most part, you don’t have to take a lot of time during your day to focus on an individual module. Finally, since these courses are available online, again, you can access them from any internet-enabled device.]]></g:description>

A business may create and offer outstanding products and services, but if their sales team aren’t performing at a high level, they will miss out on revenue.

This course will teach you how to become a successful cold caller. You will learn how to anticipate objections, how to make unsolicited calls without breaking the law and how to use positive communication to build a rapport with your lead. The course will also teach you eight steps you can take to boost your chances of making a sale and outline how you can maintain an upbeat, positive attitude.
Handling Objections &amp; Overcoming Barriers to Sales Certificate
The best salespeople do not see objections as obstacles; instead, they are merely problems to be solved or a sign that the customer needs further information. This course will teach you how to overcome barriers to a sale by understanding your customers’ wants and needs, asking the right questions and establishing your credibility.

You will learn about the most common objections you will encounter as a salesperson, how to prevent and overcome misunderstandings, how to handle complaints following a sale and the correct order in which to tackle problems or questions.

With practice, you can set yourself up for continual success, which will translate into more sales.
Skills to Succeed at Selling Certificate
This course addresses the steps salespeople take when building a relationship with a customer, offering them the best solution for their needs, negotiating terms and conditions and closing the sale. Selling is not a job that anyone and everyone can do; it demands a specific set of abilities.

It outlines 10 distinct skills that you need to master and gives advice on how to become competent in each area. You will learn how to develop them with help from a mentor and why it is important to take regular, honest inventories of your strengths and weaknesses.

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Substances and Hazard (Health &amp; Safety) Diploma
Health and safety is a key issue across all industries. Good health and safety practices reduce the risk of accidents, illness and death. A safe working environment also improves employee morale, reduces the number of days taken off sick, lowers staff turnover and enhances a business’ reputation as a desirable place to work.

This bundle addresses some of the most common health and safety concerns found in the workplace, including carbon monoxide and construction dust. These courses will help you fulfil your obligations under health and safety law. You will learn about key Health and Safety Executive (HSE) guidelines which should form the backbone of your health and safety policies.
What You Will Learn
This combined course includes the following:

 	Asbestos Awareness Certificate
 	Blood-borne Pathogens &amp; Exposure Control Plan Certificate
 	Carbon Monoxide Awareness Certificate
 	The Dangers of Construction Dust Certification
 	Control Of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Certification
 	Legionnaires’ Disease Awareness Certificate
 	Sharps Injuries Awareness Certificate

Asbestos Awareness Course
Asbestos can be found in many UK buildings. Banned in 1999, asbestos is known to cause serious diseases including cancer. Therefore, it is a major health and safety hazard. It is important to note that this course does not qualify you as an asbestos specialist. However, it will equip you with all the working knowledge you need to uphold health and safety guidelines in the workplace.

This course provides you with an overview of the history and uses of asbestos. You will learn about the risks associated with the different types of asbestos, how you can protect yourself and others from its effects and the legislation that governs how people should work with this material.
Blood-borne Pathogens &amp; Exposure Control Plan Certificate
Anyone who is exposed to blood during the course of their work needs to be aware of the dangers associated with blood-borne pathogens. Blood-borne pathogens can cause serious diseases, including hepatitis. To mitigate this risk, you must implement a suitable Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan.

This course will show you how to devise and write such a plan, taking into account the specific risks faced by employees at your place of work. It will address the information you must include, how to incorporate the plan into employee training programmes and how workers should respond in the event of an exposure incident.
Carbon Monoxide Awareness Certificate
Carbon monoxide is a tasteless, odourless gas that can kill within hours. Known as the “silent killer,” it is a serious health and safety concern. This course will teach you how and why carbon monoxide is so harmful, why it should be addressed in every health and safety plan and how to mitigate its effects.

The course will help you undertake a risk assessment to gauge the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning and install suitable warning systems. You will learn how to spot the early signs of carbon monoxide poisoning and how to liaise with third parties to prevent a recurrence.
The Dangers of Construction Dust Certification
Construction dust can result in serious health conditions, such as silicosis. It can also play a role in the development of lung cancer. Therefore, anyone who works with or encounters construction dust at work, needs to be aware of these risks and take suitable preventative measures.

In this course, you will learn about the types of construction dust people encounter in the workplace, the role of Respiratory Protective Equipment (RPE) in reducing the risk of harm and why ongoing health surveillance can detect early warning signs of health problems.
Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Certification
Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) regulations are a broad set of laws that address the risk posed by harmful substances. Even workplaces that appear safe and clean, such as offices, can contain hazards.

This course will teach you the nature and scope of COSHH regulations and the consequences of noncompliance. You will learn how to carry out a risk assessment and use the findings as the basis for health and safety policies at work. You will also discover how to monitor exposure to these hazards.
Legionnaires’ Disease Awareness Certificate
Of the 300 cases of Legionnaires’ disease reported in England and Wales each year, most occur in the workplace. This bacteria grows in water systems, and those working with these systems are at particular risk.

In this course, you will learn about the conditions most likely to promote the growth of harmful bacteria and how you can conduct a risk assessment to gauge the likelihood that your systems will facilitate its cultivation. You will learn how to take preventative measures and how to test for the presence of bacteria.
Sharps Injuries Awareness Certificate
Sharps injuries, which are most often seen in health and social care settings, can cause lasting damage to a person’s physical and mental health.

This course will teach you how sharps injuries occur, why they are dangerous and the most common scenarios in which they occur. You will learn how to train employees to use sharps in a safe manner, how to dispose of them after use and how to respond following a sharps injury. You will also learn how to keep records of all incidents.
The Benefits of Our Health &amp; Safety Bundle

 	The information contained in these courses will help you create a safe, healthy workplace in which all employees can thrive

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Complete Writing and Proofreading Diploma
The written word is everywhere. Regardless of the specific job you work or the hobbies you have, familiarity with writing skills is a key part of your success. Without being able to express yourself clearly, appropriately and concisely, you are not going to be understood and may miss out on opportunities – both career-wise and in life.

The writing course bundle includes carefully curated content designed to help you become a better writer regardless of initial skill level. Everything from basic grammar skills to finding ways to consistently create new and interesting content is covered. Students, sales staff, administrative professionals and even CEOs can benefit from the tips, tools and lessons contained in this bundle.
You Will Learn:
This combined course bundle includes:

 	Advanced Spelling
 	Business Report Writing
 	Content Creation
 	Copywriting
 	How to Write Better Emails
 	Note Taking
 	Proofreading
 	Punctuation Mastery
 	Writing Sales Proposals
 	Writing Skills Certificate

&nbsp;
Advanced Spelling
Having excellent spelling skills is a huge asset in any job, helping you get your message across exactly as intended. Unfortunately, the English language is not exactly straightforward, with many seemingly conflicting rules about capitalisation, prefixes, suffixes and phonetics. This course reviews the most common mistakes people make when spelling, giving you the ability to improve your writing and communicate with ease.
Business Report Writing
Many companies use business reports as the basis for numerous decisions, including the allocation of resources and distribution of staff. Reports are also used to track a project’s progress and to communicate the results of various campaigns. Learn how to write persuasive and factual business reports with this thorough course covering all the basics.
Content Creation
It can be hard to get your message out to the masses, especially if you are just starting to create your own content. There is a lot of work that goes into determining what your target market wants, how they want it delivered and how to put it together in a way that they are going to find interesting. This course reviews each detail of content creation, telling you how to put together images, texts and videos geared to inspiring your audience and gaining more page views.
Copywriting
Copywriting is a skill that is a lot more involved than it sounds. Taking existing information and transforming it to suit your needs involves research skills, familiarity with search engine optimisation, as well as the ability to carefully craft a clear and compelling message. Learn how to adapt to different tones, implement SEO strategies in your work and connect with your audience.
How to Write Better Emails
Experts believe that there were over 281 billion emails sent and received each day throughout 2018. By 2022, they believe this number is going to grow to more than 333 billion. This means it is more important now than ever before to understand how to use email to your advantage. Learn more about email etiquette and other tips on how to get your message read.
Note Taking
Note taking is an incredibly useful skill; one that can push you to excel in the classroom as well as the boardroom. Carefully writing down information as you are hearing it helps you to process it faster, commit more to memory and gives you a resource if there are disputes later on. This course teaches you several techniques you can use to improve your note-taking skills.
Proofreading
Everyone makes mistakes, but you don’t have to let those errors sneak out into the world. Careful proofreading takes your writing to the next level, removing all the typos and grammatical mistakes and leaving only your well-written words behind. Learn the fundamentals of proofreading, including the most common mistakes writers tend to make.
Punctuation Mastery
Punctuation misuse is one of the most common errors made when writing. Something as minor as a wrong comma or misplaced apostrophe can change the entire meaning of a sentence. This course goes into detail about the punctuation rules all English writers should know, including how to use commas, semicolons and quotation marks in your work.
Writing Sales Proposals
A perfectly written sales proposal can quite literally change your life. A sales proposal is at the heart of most major business deals. If your prospective client cannot understand the heart of your pitch, they are not going to invest in your product. Learn how to put together sales proposals your clients find easy to understand and incredibly compelling.
Writing Skills Certificate
Good writing skills can carry you far, leading to success in school, in business and even in your personal life. This course gives you the skills you need to communicate well in every area of your life.

      <g:description><![CDATA[The UK General Data Protection Regulation

The GDPR still applies to the UK despite having now left the EU. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been retained in UK law with only some small changes. The key principles, rights and obligations remain the same. It is now known as the UK GDPR. In this course, 'GDPR' refers to both the EU and UK GDPR. Where the information relates specifically to the UK or EU GDPR, this will be referred to as UK GDPR or EU GDPR.

Over the years, the way companies and organisations collect, use, and maintain data has changed dramatically. For example, the electronic storage of data is a relatively new concept and one that has not always been adequately addressed by existing legislation.

With these changes in mind, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was created. Experts believe that it is one of the most important pieces of data protection legislation drafted within the last 20 years. It is important that everyone involved in the collection, storage and processing of personal data be aware of the GDPR and its implications. This course is an introduction to the scope and purpose of the GDPR.
You Will Learn:

 	What the GDPR is, why it was introduced, when it came into effect, its relationship to previous legislation, and who must comply with the new rules.
 	The principles underlying the GDPR, the bases on which an organisation is permitted to collect and process data, and how the GDPR makes provision for the handling of highly sensitive personal information.
 	The rights granted to individuals under the GDPR, and what this means for organisations who collect and process data.

Benefits of Taking This Course:

 	If your job entails the regular collection, storage or handling of personal data, this course will provide you with an invaluable introduction to your obligations under the GDPR.
 	If you own a business, this course will help you understand when and how you may collect data from clients and consumers and process it in a lawful manner.
 	If you work in a management role, this course will help you advise members of your team with regards to handling and processing consumer data.
 	If you are responsible for implementing data handling and processing policies at your place of work, this course will give you a good starting point from which to draft them.
 	If you are interested in consumer rights and privacy law, the information in this course will be of general interest to you

      <g:description><![CDATA[The Key Stages of the National Curriculum Certificate

The National Curriculum is a complex document, setting out how the education system in the UK should run. Everyone from parents and teachers to carers need to be intimately familiar with how it works if they want the children in their lives to succeed. 

One reason why the document can be difficult to understand is how it breaks down the subject matter. Each Key Stage represents several years, which correspond to different ages. Thankfully, examining each stage on its own makes it easier to comprehend the National Curriculum. 

This course breaks down the National Curriculum into its individual parts. We begin by giving you a brief overview of the material covered. 

Next, we talk about each stage on its own, telling you what you need to know to help the children you know succeed at each stage. 

Finally, we talk about other compulsory material that must be covered. 

You Will Learn:


	Which years and ages are associated with each Key Stage
	Information about the Early Years Foundation Stage and Sixth Form
	Which specific subjects are covered under the National Curriculum
	When testing is performed and what kind of tests are administered 
	Details about other compulsory subjects, including Sex Education and Religious Education



Benefits of Taking This Course: 


	Learn more about when you can expect teachers to start introducing homework 
	Understand which subject materials are mandatory for all students 
	If you are a carer or involved in early childhood education, understanding what is taught at the primary school level can help you enrich your own lesson planning to better prepare the children in your care for year one
	If you are interested in becoming a teacher, learning more about what you can anticipate as you teach children in each stage
	If you are a parent, learning more about what your child is learning in school and how you can help encourage success

      <g:description><![CDATA[Thomas–Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument Certificate
Conflicts are almost a certainty. While in some situations, conflicts are harmless, there are other cases where these types of situations can cause tension. Sometimes it is easy to work through these challenging situations, but when things are hard to deal with, it can be useful to access tools that will help defuse the issue. This is where the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) comes into play.

Professors of management, Ken Thomas, PhD and Ralph Kilmann PhD, created the TKI Conflict Mode Instrument to help with conflict resolution. The TKI works with organisations and individuals to help assess how they deal with conflicts and when/where they can make changes so that effective resolutions can be made. It can be hard to imagine that every conflict will turn out okay, but with the approach that the TKI Conflict Mode instrument takes, it is possible. Not only can this assist a person in their day-to-day life, but organisations can implement it to encourage a better workflow. By assessing an individual and providing them with an in-depth analysis of how to react to certain conflict situations, this can not only empower an individual to make the right choice, but will also teach them how to handle future, unexpected conflict situations.
You Will Learn

 	What the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI) is and why it is a useful management tool
 	How the TKI works and when it can be applied
 	About the five conflict-handling modes that can be implemented in almost every conflict situation
 	The benefits of the TKI not just for individuals, but also for members of an organisation
 	How one can obtain TKI training and certification

Benefits Of Taking this Course

 	You will learn about the TKI and why it has been such a success with individuals and organisations since being published in the 1970s. Additionally, individuals can learn how to implement the results of the assessment test in real-life situations.
 	You will learn about the TKI and how it works to create an in-depth conflict resolution profile for an individual. This profile will essentially indicate how a person should approach each conflict.
 	You will get an understanding of the five conflict-handling modes and will know what situations they should be applied.
 	You will learn what the benefits of TKI training are and why the assessment can help individuals approach conflicts with more acceptance of the situation.
 	You will know how to obtain TKI training and certification and other assessment tests, their benefits, and why using some of them in combination with the TKI can yield even better results.

      <g:title><![CDATA[Working with Lift Trucks Certificate]]></g:title>
      <g:description><![CDATA[Working with Lift Trucks Certificate
Many industries depend on lift trucks as they are extremely useful tools in moving heavy materials. Lift trucks (also known as forklifts) are essential to various lines of business. For those who begin working as a lift truck operator, they can go on to become worksite managers, supervisors and trainers. However, as good and as necessary as lift trucks are, they are large and dangerous pieces of equipment and must be handled properly and safely. If used without authorisation, they can result in fatalities. Not only do business owners and employers need to obtain lift truck licences, but site employees also need to be certified to handle such vehicles. Therefore, it is essential for employers to develop and implement training programmes tailored to the job itself. Workers should also look to obtain the proper form of basic training beforehand. This way employers can gauge the safety knowledge that a prospective employee has and can train accordingly.

To learn how to safely work with lift trucks, one should receive a rounded education. This should include learning about commonly used lift trucks, how to obtain the necessary training and what can happen if a lift truck is handled without experience. In this course: 
You Will Learn

 	The importance of knowing how to safely operate a lift truck
 	About lift truck training programmes
 	About commonly used lift trucks
 	The dangers of operating a lift truck without authorisation
 	About refresher courses and additional training programmes

Benefits Of Taking this Course

 	Employers and site personnel will learn about the responsibilities of safely operating a lift truck and the hazards associated with poor handling
 	Learn about safety standards and guidelines and worksite employees will learn how to find the right accredited programme
 	Familiarisation of six commonly used lift trucks, what they are used for and what environments that can be driven in
 	Employers and workers will learn how to avoid dangerous situations with examples of dangerous operation
 	Staff and employers will learn why refresher courses are mandatory and how they can help in meeting safety guidelines

      <g:description><![CDATA[Workplace Hygiene Certificate

Health hazards are a major concern, and implementing proper health and safety measures is a vital part of everyday life. For many, everyday life can mean spending most days at work, making the need for good hygiene somewhat of a necessity in the workplace. But regardless of whether it is for personal needs or to ensure successful workplace operation, keeping good hygiene is necessary in keeping illnesses at bay. 

It is no hidden fact that many diseases are as a result of poor hygiene. Not only do employers need to provide a clean and healthy work environment for their employees, but individuals must also work alongside their employers to maintain proper individual hygiene as well. 

Every business must adhere to health and safety standards depending on where the business is located. Local laws and regulations provide guidelines for businesses on what level of proper hygiene must be implemented.

      <g:description><![CDATA[Yoga - Sun Salutations
Surya Namaskar is the Sanskrit word which means 'To salute the sun'.

This course will take you through a series of asanas, or poses, to create a graceful sequence of yoga positions.

This pattern of exercise is usually performed at sunrise or sunset in India. It is a perfect warm-up at the beginning of a Yoga session.

The flow gives mobility to the whole body. Salutations to the sun stretch and lengthen the joints, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Special attention is paid to the spine.

The arrangement is executed in quick succession and combined with breathing. They are practised with intensifying pace until the entire body has warmed up and is prepared for additional asana practice.

There are many forms of the sequence, although in this course you will learn three of them.

In the first Sun Salutation the whole sequence, which involves 12 asanas, is coordinated in a smooth flow, with attention given to correct breathing.

Sun Salutation A and B are also demonstrated. They follow a similar sequence with variations. Upward Dog, 3 Leg Dog, Chaturanga and Warrior 1 are among the fascinating poses included in these variations.

The whole sequence emphasises grace, works muscles and joints and focuses on reconnecting with the pattern of one's breathing.

The sequence ends with the word Namaste which means 'The light in me recognises the light in you'.

The spiritual dimension which underlies the exercise sequence is unmistakable but not strictly necessary for the exercises to be effective.
What you will learn:

 	The exercise sequence for the Sun Salutations
 	The importance of proper breathing.
 	Basic yoga asanas and the importance of making them flow into a smooth dance-like sequence.
 	Basic Sanskrit expressions.
 	The names of the various yoga asanas and the related exercises.
 	The long history behind these exercises and the spiritual dimension which underpins them.

Benefits of the course:

 	To understand and practise basic yoga asanas or poses.
 	Create an awareness of clarity of thought and calm, which you can use in your own life.
 	To understand the importance of proper breathing.
 	It will give you simple step-by-step demonstrations of the major yoga poses.
 	It will teach you to be relaxed, focused and centred
 	It will also show you that gentle exercise can make you toned, flexible and help you lose weight
 	Become aware of and in tune with your body, which will help you detect any physical or psychological health problems.
